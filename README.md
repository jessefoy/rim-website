## Stack

- **GitHub** — version control and source of truth
- **Netlify** — hosting and automatic deployment
- **Sanity** — content management (events, classes, bios, schedules)

## How It Works

Every push to `main` triggers an automatic Netlify deploy (~30 seconds).

Content that changes regularly (events, schedules, teacher bios) is managed through Sanity Studio — no code required.

## Development

Design and layout changes are made by editing files in this repository. Push to `main` and Netlify deploys automatically.

## Content Updates

Log in to Sanity Studio to update events, classes, schedules, and other regularly-changing content.
