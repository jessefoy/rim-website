                    <p>RIM teachers are committed to sharing the teachings and practices through the traditional approach of dāna/generosity. By sharing in this way, the teacher protects the integrity of the Dharma, keeps the teachings available to everyone, and fosters space for connection, trust, and mutual care.<br></p>
                    <p><strong>RIM Teachers receive no payment or compensation from RIM</strong> for offering classes, workshops, drop-ins, retreats, or any other offerings to the RIM community. Any suggested donation to RIM, including Sustaining Member donations, pay for operational costs.<br></p>
                    <p><strong>RIM Teacher&#x27;s livelihood is supported only through voluntary donations (<em>dāna</em>). </strong>RIM Teachers have similar financial obligations as everyone else, such as family expenses, tuition repayment, food, utilities, insurance, health care, car payments, family expenses, ongoing training, retreats, etc. Voluntary Teacher Dana allows them to live and teach, knowing they are safe and supported enough to share the teachings freely. <br></p>
                    <p><strong>RIM Teachers elected to dedicate their lives to the practice and the sharing of the Dharma. </strong>Our teachers receive ongoing intensive training and are deeply committed to living a mindful life. This focus and commitment uphold the teacher&#x27;s ability to share the Dharma with authenticity, wisdom, compassion, and integrity. <br></p>

      <p class="section-text-2-copy">Dana (pronounced "DAH-nuh&quot;) is a traditional Pali term that translates as &quot;generosity, gift, alms, donation, etc.&quot; Dana is a voluntary offering of materials, time, energy, or care to others. Dana is regarded as one of the most potent virtues for awakening the best within ourselves while benefiting the world.<br>‍<br>RIM is co-created through its community&#x27;s generosity, goodwill, and appreciation. RIM is a living expression of generosity, and it is 100% community funded and entirely dependent on donations. <br><br><strong>Donations pay for all operating costs, contribute to teacher livelihood, and maintain its building. </strong><br><br>Dana challenges the conventional fee-for-service models, and instead, strengthens our intentions to give from a place of mutual understanding and care. <strong>RIM does not charge any &quot;fees,&quot; instead, we ask that all members agree to contribute an amount that feels right to them</strong><em>.<br>‍</em><br>It&#x27;s beautiful to have a refuge that is co-created through the wisdom, compassion, and generosity of its community. Thanks for being part of it.</p>

        <p class="white-text align-text-left">Dana (Generosity) practice is deep and personal. It reflects what is alive in your heart, life, and the world. Ultimately, the invitation is to give what feels suitable for yourself and others rather than through pressure or obligation.<br><br>The practice of Dana goes against the stream of our modern, transaction-base system and it can be challenging to know how much to give. While we can&#x27;t tell you how much to give because Dana is a personal practice, we can offer some mindful contemplations to help you get started.<br></p>
