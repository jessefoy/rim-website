The group provided direct instruction to students, trained classroom teachers, facilitated parent groups, and provided staff in-service. Amy continues to teach mindfulness to students with the active participation of parents and school staff.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/672f6c0c76764089a1dd1e81_6668c0e41cf895ee4ea603e5_boy%2520meditating.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee:</em></strong> Hi Amy, thank you so much for talking with us today. Your journey of bringing mindfulness to kids in Milwaukee area schools is truly inspiring, and I believe many people would love to hear about your experiences.</p><p id="""">Can you start by telling us a little about your background? What inspired you to become a meditation teacher for kids? Why do you feel called to do this?</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Amy: </em></strong>Hmm. That's an interesting question to contemplate. Teaching was not a career I'd initially thought about or went to school for. It was never on my radar.</p><p id="""">Right after I graduated from undergrad in college, I spent several months in India. I was overwhelmed by the world's trouble and the difficulty I saw and experienced. At 23 years of age, I was considering different ideas about what to do with my life. I had a 'save the world' kind of mentality. But soon, it became very clear to me that, oh my goodness, education was the path! I could be a part of investing in our kids' future - so I went into education. That was a dramatic shift in achieving how, why, and what I wanted to do with my life.</p><p id="""">Early in my teaching career, I also began seeing what my yoga and meditation practice did for my life as a teacher and parent. As a more mature adult, the importance of sharing these practices with children became evident. </p><p id="""">Once on that path, I began using movement as a vehicle for supporting kids and maintaining wellness and health in their bodies. We shared practices that encouraged paying attention to their bodies, noticing emotions, and recognizing how their emotions feel in their bodies. As I expanded my own meditation and mindfulness practice, I began sharing the practices in a more meaningful way. My collaborating colleagues and I began to see the need to help kids and teachers find some self-regulation and self-awareness tools. We developed a curriculum to respond to those needs.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee:</em></strong> Did you get pushback or resistance when you suggested offering this type of training to kids?</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Amy:</em></strong> In the beginning, there wasn't much resistance. Some parents asked that their children refrain from participating in the programs we were offering. Some teachers and staff resisted for various reasons—but overall, the program was well accepted.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee:</em></strong> Our readers would be interested in this work's influence on your life. </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Amy:</em></strong> The influences have been dramatic. So many influences come to mind, but the ones that made a profound impact are patience and letting go. Patience is helpful when dealing with behaviors and difficulties that children arrive with, and so is letting go of my expectations of how the practice with the children should look. </p><p id="""">We worked diligently on a curriculum and revised it many, many, many times to make it relevant, personal, and adaptable to the current conditions and the needs of the students. When we walked into a classroom of kids or met with a group of teachers, we had a clearly defined set of goals and activities that we intended to share. But sometimes, following the plan just did not happen. </p><p id="""">Sometimes, we walked into a room and found a wholly dysregulated environment. I learned how important it was to let go of my expectations and be patient—patient with myself and patient with the needs of an individual child or the teacher—so I could meet them with compassion in that moment. Patience and learning to let go of expectations were real shifting points in my practice.</p><p id="""">I can remember several years into teaching, I was working with a group of teachers and expressed the following insight: ""I'm not here to teach these practices. I'm here to share this practice. I'm here to provide an experience."" &nbsp;That was a huge shift from teaching to sharing - using patience, letting go of expectations, meeting the moment, and broadening the experience for myself and the students.</p><p id="""">I've learned to hold the planned curriculum more lightly, seeing that simply sitting down and doing a few breaths together often had more impact than completing all the skills I intended to teach or checking off all the boxes on the curriculum. It was a living practice. With time, I learned to show up, be prepared, and bring my formal meditation and mindful living practices to every classroom I walked into. Yes, there was a lot of different energy and effort to meet.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee:</em></strong><em id=""""> </em>Could you give us a little scenario about a day in the life of Amy Gardner teaching mindfulness to a class?</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Amy: </em></strong>Gosh, well, I'll speak about the formal curriculum we tried to keep somewhat consistent but often unfolded differently depending on the setting. There was a routine - walking into the space, checking in, noticing what was alive at the moment in myself and with the energy of the classroom. It's very similar to what we do in a drop-in here at RIM… a kind of settling-in.</p><p id="""">We usually began with a breathing practice and then asked for feedback about how they had been using the tools and practices from previous classes. This little bit of sharing helped us understand the relevance of the practices: what was resonating with the kids and what was not working so well. </p><p id="""">We always had some movement planned for the session. We found movement in the classrooms was really, really important - whether it was just with hands, the body, standing, or more gross motor movement. The curriculum was movement-based for the younger kids, less so as the students got older. But, there was always a practice, some guidance, and teaching related to awareness, self-regulation, understanding emotions, kindness<strong id="""">,</strong> and compassion - the curriculum had an actual scaffolding and unfolding of all the practices. Students knew what to expect in each session. </p><p id="""">That being said, sometimes I walked into a classroom, and none of that happened at all. Sometimes, I did something dramatically different because I could see that there was agitation in the group, and the planned curriculum wasn't what was needed.<strong id=""""> </strong>As you can imagine, a myriad of circumstances may have made it impractical to go through the curriculum, so I had to meet what was alive in the room.</p><p id="""">Sometimes, it meant moving the desks, sitting in a circle, and sharing. Sometimes, it meant standing up and doing a lot of movement and just regulating the systems, shaking, and doing some vagus nerve balancing practices. I always had a mental basket of practices, activities, and games that I could pull out at a moment's notice.</p><p id="""">Sometimes, the opposite energy was present. For example, when walking into a middle school classroom, with everyone seemingly sleeping with their heads on their desks; I would offer energizing movement and games.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee:</em></strong> So flexibility was the key? </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Amy:</em></strong><em id=""""> </em>Yes … flexibility. </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee:</em></strong> What keeps bringing you back to the classroom week after week?</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Amy: </em></strong>That's an interesting question, and it makes me emotional. I could say many things, but I see such a dire need for our young people to be seen, heard, and understood. Mindfulness is such a simple practice to bring kids together and meet each other with kindness and compassion. They learn the words and practices needed to bring these awareness practices into their everyday lives. They begin to trust their own wisdom and compassion<strong id="""">. </strong>And that's how the world starts to change.</p><p id="""">There are simple ways we can do this with kids that don't cost much money and don't take a lot of time. You don't need anything special to support our young people with these simple things that can make a dramatic difference in their lives.</p><p id="""">And I see it work. I've seen it over the years, over and over and over again. Kids shift not only their behaviors but also their mindsets, their ideas about themselves, their care for themselves, and their willingness to be more intentional with their lives - how they treat themselves and others. And so, what brings me back is joy, great joy for that shift in their mindset and inspiration for a hopeful future.</p><p id="""">Joy and inspiration<strong id=""""> </strong>repeatedly move me to share mindfulness practices and to share the dharma for the greater good of our world. It's also beneficial for me because I'm continually learning, growing, and sharing. Sharing these practices in meaningful ways <em id="""">is</em> the practice.</p><p id="""">It took me a while, but I learned that teaching mindfulness is not something I could just talk about. I had to show up in my own practice over and over again. It's been infinitely beneficial for me. So yeah, the kids bring me much joy, and I'm ever deepening my practice.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee:</em></strong> Speaking of joy, do you have any memorable quotes from the kids you work with that brightened your day, brought on the joy, and kept you returning to the classroom?</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Amy:</em></strong> Well, I keep a little book with quotes from students and teachers. Some bring me great joy, while others are really eye-opening and gut-wrenching. They are all reminders of how transformational these simple practices can be. </p><p id="""">I recall a quote from a little 5-year-old boy. It was the first time we were doing mindful breathing. We talked about stillness. We practiced alternating between motion and stillness. We did mindful breathing with some movement, using what we called flower hands, breathing while opening and closing our hands with the in and out breath. By the way, when you have thirty-plus five-year-olds mindfully breathing with you, it's pretty magical.</p><p id="""">After mindful breathing, I asked the kids to open their eyes and let me know how they felt. I'll never forget seeing this little kid's face sitting in front of me. His eyes lit up full of surprise, and he said, ""Miss Amy, I feel <em id="""">different</em>."" I think this little guy realized the <em id="""">felt sense</em> of being still and quiet on purpose. <em id="""">And</em> he could do it. At that moment, I thought, ""Okay, these five-year-olds can get this stuff, too.""</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee</em></strong><em id="""">:</em> That's a ""drop the mic moment.""</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Amy:</em></strong> I know it was, and if you could see his face, his eyes, and his surprise. It was really sweet.</p><p id="""">On the other end of the spectrum, there were remarkable moments with high schoolers, which often occurred in really challenging environments.</p><p id="""">I can feel it now as I am talking about it. There was a student who did not engage in class at all. He had his hood up and head on the desk most of the time. He never responded and never engaged in the practice. At the end of each term, we ask the students to fill out a little survey with questions like: Have you used the practice? Would you recommend it to others? Where have you found it helpful? </p><p id="""">This seemingly non-engaged kid explained<strong id=""""> </strong>on the survey, which I won't quote here to protect his privacy, that he had an altercation in the bathroom at school. Instead of using violence to cope, he used mindful breathing instead of hurting another student. It was profound to see how he benefitted from the practice. I have so many similar quotes I could share!</p><p id="""">I've learned that just showing up for these kids over and over again sometimes speaks more than the practices they learn. Those are the moments that keep me coming back.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee</em></strong><em id="""">:</em> These direct expressions from the kids are important. They paint a picture that no verbal description could do.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Amy:</em></strong> Yes, right. So many other experiences were game-changers for me. </p><p id="""">For example, a parent came into the school to talk about her 7th-grade child who had anger issues. This child was working with the school and a therapist outside of school, and he <em id="""">wanted </em>help, too. He was working hard but still struggling. </p><p id="""">One of our lessons involved a bit about brain science, understanding the amygdala as the reactive part of the brain. When we feel certain emotions, the amygdala, the fight-or-flight part of our brain, gets activated. In that state, we're kind of disconnected from our prefrontal cortex. We sometimes call it the <em id="""">downstairs and upstairs brain</em>, depending on the age of the kids we're talking to. We tell the kids that the amygdala is activated when we are highly emotional, and our decision-making and discerning part of the brain is somewhat offline.</p><p id="""">This particular student, who was struggling with anger issues, came home and shared this lesson with his mother and said, ""I'm so glad I learned about that. I'm so glad I know how my brain works. I used to think there was something wrong with me. Now I really understand that it's just anger happening in the moment.""</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee:</em></strong> That's everything!</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Amy:</em></strong> Right? Seventh grade! That was pretty sweet. Kids could shift from thinking, ""Something is wrong with me because I have anger."" to ""Now I know some practices to help me control it."" The practices help the kids to see that they have tools to regulate their emotions and responses. They can choose.<strong id=""""> </strong></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee:</em></strong> Amy, thank you for sharing your remarkable story with our sangha. You bring so much to the RIM community, and learning about your important work with children is compelling.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">LoriLee Villwock and Christine Jacobi edited and condensed this interview for clarity and length. </em></p><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.rootedinmindfulness.org/team/amy-gardner"" id="""">See Amy's Gardner's Bio</a></p><p id=""""><a href=""https://view.flodesk.com/emails/65652d4676d8419ffa83d513"" id="""">→Back to Voices Community Connections</a></p>"

After 22 years of pediatric cancer research at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Vicki reinvented herself to pursue a career as an ornithologist. It was a turn towards a lifelong love of nature that began as a child in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and continued into her adult years.</p><p id="""">Vicki and her husband, Larry Hopwood, have meditated for decades. While searching for a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course in 2005, Vicki found RIM. She went on to take two MBSR classes at RIM with Jesse Foy, RIM’s guiding teacher. </p><p id="""">These many years later, Vicki remains an active RIM member and participant in many drop-in sessions and retreats. She volunteers as a greeter and helps provide flowers for the meditation hall. As a member of RIM’s Nature Meditation KM group, Vicki led a wonderful hike through Havenwoods State Forest in 2024.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatleft""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/67c6020b778d565dcd88b1d2_Bird%20Watchers.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:&nbsp;How did you make the mid-career change from medical research to ornithology?</em></strong></p><p id="""">I worked at Children's Hospital as a med tech and then I went right into research. It was such an exciting time. They were just discovering some of the cures for childhood leukemia. I loved the work, but I still had a keen interest in the outdoors.</p><p id="""">I worked full-time at Children's and volunteered at a bird banding field station every Saturday in the fall. I volunteered at the field station for a long time; enough to know that it was truly what I wanted to do.</p><p id="""">After a stint of working as a bird bander in the UP of Michigan, the station manager suggested I would be a good fit for an international bird research project.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""max-width:45%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width=""45%""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/67afbba9b9443fa177dfa81b_Vicki%20with%20Book.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><blockquote id="""">I was hired to be the international coordinator of <em id="""">Birds without Borders-Aves Sin Fronteras,</em> a bird research, conservation, and education project of the Zoological Society of Milwaukee and Foundation for Wildlife Conservation. We studied migratory and resident birds in both Wisconsin and Belize, Central America.</blockquote><p id="""">We got a grant from the US Fish and Wildlife Service to compile two beautiful manuals, one for Wisconsin and one for Belize, with many pictures for landowners and information on how they could manage their land to benefit birds. </p><p id="""">I traveled, giving talks about birds, our research, and bird conservation, distributing copies of the manual free of charge. An e-copy of the manual can be requested at newsletter@rootedinmindfulness.org. </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:&nbsp;How is your mindfulness practice connected to your love of nature?</em></strong></p><p id="""">I find that being out in nature is such a feast for the senses. There are so many things to see, smell, notice, enjoy, explore and learn about. When in nature, I feel aware and find it natural to be mindful and appreciative of all that is around me.</p><p id="""">That same felt-sense you get when you meditate is what you feel when you are in nature. It just happens. Meditating in nature and meditating at home are different. At home, I have to set aside time and set the stage. Meditating in nature just seems to occur without effort. </p><blockquote id="""">Learning to be mindful and aware when you're sitting and meditating leads to the awareness you bring into the world. I think my love of nature—birds and plants—enhances my awareness.</blockquote><p id="""">I love being here at RIM, too. Jessie says it's truly a refuge, and it is. When first walking through RIM's door, it takes me a while to settle my mind. In short order, I just feel different. I also love being at a retreat center, doing walking meditation outdoors, and trying different types of meditation.</p><p id="""">I am still involved in community-based teaching about Ornithology, which involves being mindful of the people you train. I plan how I can utilize my loving-kindness practice to be a better teacher.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:&nbsp;Do you have a particular bird on your list that you’d like to see?</em></strong></p><p id="""">I feel fortunate to have seen and observed many species of birds in Wisconsin, the US, and beyond. When I travel, I keep a trip list and then try to study and learn more about the bird species on that list. It's exciting, but it's also a learning experience.</p><blockquote id="""">I don’t really have any other birds that I would like to see, although I welcome the opportunity to see a species that is new to me when it arises.</blockquote><p id="""">I do get excited about seeing rose-breasted grosbeaks return in spring and seeing black-capped chickadees year-round. I did my thesis research on chickadees and learned a lot about them. I am amazed at how these small birds can survive our Wisconsin winters and how smart they are!</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/67c606855307a002604aeadf_Screenshot%202025-03-03%20at%201.42.58%E2%80%AFPM.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Black-capped Chickadee</figcaption></figure><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft"" style=""max-width:30%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatleft"" data-rt-max-width=""30%""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/67c604b0afd3904b401664d6_Screenshot%202025-03-03%20at%201.35.06%E2%80%AFPM.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id=""""> Rose-breasted Grosbeak</figcaption></figure><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:&nbsp;The ability of birds to travel and navigate such distances is fascinating. &nbsp;Can you tell us a little about bird migrations?</em></strong></p><p id="""">Migration is one of the most fascinating aspects of a bird’s annual lifecycle. The main reason birds migrate is food. In Fall, the change in seasons causes a decrease in food supply, and birds move to an area where food is more plentiful. In Spring, birds migrate to their breeding areas. About 60 to 80% of birds that breed in North America migrate between their breeding and nonbreeding homes. These journeys can be &nbsp;thousand miles or more. Even very small birds like an Ovenbird, which weighs only about as much as eight pennies, will make this journey twice a year. Some birds migrate to the southern US; others travel to the islands in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central and South America.</p><p id="""">Birds navigate using landmarks like rivers and coasts. Birds also use 3 types of “compasses.” They use the position of the sun during the day and the setting sun at night to know which direction to fly. They use celestial navigation (the patterns of the stars in the sky) and memorize the position of constellations in relation to the North Star. This allows them to use the stars to navigate. That's incredible. Birds have tiny grains of magnetite just above their nostrils so that they can sense the earth's magnetic field. This helps to know the direction of true north. Some birds travel over land, while others fly nonstop across large bodies of water or along coastal areas. </p><p id="""">There are theories about why birds make these risky long migrations. The one most widely accepted now is that if birds stay in the tropics, due to food limitations, they only lay two to three eggs. If they migrate north (e.g., to Wisconsin) in summer, there are mosquitoes and so many other insects —all great bird food. Consequently, in Wisconsin, birds can now lay five to six eggs and have more young survive. </p><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1764px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1764px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/67c603b9e65092232fb2785e_Screenshot%202025-03-03%20at%201.31.38%E2%80%AFPM.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:&nbsp;What are some of the inherent dangers for birds during the migratory process?</em></strong><em id=""""> </em></p><p id="""">One of the major threats to flying birds is window and radio/tv tower collisions. Birds seem to be attracted to the lights. I just read an article about McCormick Place in Chicago, where thousands of birds were once killed by window collisions every year. They've now marked the windows, making the glass visible to birds, which reduces window collisions. You can reduce window collision at your home or office by marking the windows with UV strips or dots (featherfriendly.com).</p><p id="""">Loss of habitat is a major factor in bird decline. One of the best things you can do for birds is to plant native plants in your yard. Native plants contain insects and caterpillars that provide food for birds and their young.</p><p id="""">Another danger in migration is timing. The pineal gland in birds controls circadian rhythms. When light shines through their skin, hormones are released, which triggers a kind of migratory restlessness. Once triggered, they start the migratory journey. </p><p id="""">Historically, birds have returned to areas like Wisconsin in spring to find buds and tiny leaves on trees loaded with insect food and caterpillars. Everything the birds needed to thrive was available. Because of climate change, springs are warmer. Plants are budding, and insects are emerging sooner. And so there's a mismatch between when the birds arrive and when the food arrives. </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:&nbsp;Can you talk to us about the declining bird populations? Is this general or specific to a species?</em></strong><em id=""""> </em></p><p id="""">Many bird species are declining, and this is of great concern. In 2019, a large-scale analysis of wild bird populations in the US and Canada showed that all birds have declined by almost 30% since 1970. This means that more than one in four birds have been lost. </p><p id="""">Grassland birds have been particularly affected. Even hardy birds like house sparrows are declining. I volunteer with ongoing bird research, education, and conservation projects emphasizing the importance of humans preserving, restoring, and not destroying bird habitats. We also document bird numbers at different times of the year. </p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/67afb641ab374da8d4a8c6ee_Vicki%20talking%20to%20KM%20Group.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div><figcaption id="""">Vicki shares her birding knowledge with the RIM Nature Meditation KM Group</figcaption></figure><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:&nbsp;Can you share your thoughts on environmental conservation? </em></strong></p><blockquote id="""">When you appreciate nature, you want to do everything possible to help the environment and positively impact conservation.</blockquote><p id="""">Many people who love birds, or study birds or wildlife, learn about what is needed for wildlife to thrive and then realize that some of those necessities are threatened or no longer available. It naturally makes you more of a conservationist and to want to spread the word about the importance of conservation. </p><p id="""">Larry and I have native gardens because they provide insects, spiders, and fruits for the birds. In general, we try to reduce our negative impact on nature.

Once stable, they are discharged to continue their recovery at home, and Annie steps in as part of the rehabilitation team.</p><p id="""">Amid this challenging career, in 2014, Annie accepted an invitation from her friend and yoga teacher, Amy Gardner, to attend a Saturday morning drop-in session at Rooted in Mindfulness. </p><p id="""">Annie fondly recalls her first sit at RIM, laughing as she described how her mind and emotions were all over the place—but still, she felt deeply supported. She returned the next week and has been part of the community ever since.</p><p id="""">Over the following years, Annie attended RIM drop-in sessions, completed several <em id="""">Foundations of Mindfulness</em> classes, and eventually took the <em id="""">Mindfulness Mentor Support Program</em> (MMSP). The MMSP course deepened her practice and introduced a profound perspective: we are all both teachers and students on this journey.<br></p><blockquote id="""">“Applying all that to my daily life was the thing that was helping me like nothing else had ever helped. &nbsp;When I introduce the Dharma to patients in therapy sessions, they say it helped them more than anything else.” &nbsp;<br><br></blockquote><p id="""">Annie’s patients face significant challenges when they leave the hospital. She explains that returning home for rehabilitation brings its own set of difficulties, including an ambiguous and uncertain adjustment. This period is often filled with questions that may not have immediate answers—or perhaps none at all: Will I get better? How much will I recover? Will I be able to go back to work? What happens if I can’t return? I’m the main provider for my family—what now? I used to be able to do this, but now I can't. This uncertainty can make the transition both physically and emotionally overwhelming.</p><p id="""">Annie explains that Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) often result from split-second events, such as a fall, a motor vehicle accident, an overdose, or a stroke. The degree of impairment varies widely, ranging from mild concussions that may resolve within days or weeks to severe TBIs that can permanently impact a person’s ability to live independently.</p><p id="""">These sudden, life-altering changes leave little to no time for preparation, making the experience deeply traumatic for the individual and their families. They must navigate an entirely new reality.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatleft""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/673f43522163f452ae028cbb_673f4348974dc2e8e3d5cc7f_Annie%2527s%2520Buddha%25202.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Families often face the profound loss of the person they once knew as their relationship with that person changes. For example, after a brain injury occurs, a spouse may now also take on the role of caregiver. In some cases, their partner might seem childlike or unable to fulfill the role they once held in the relationship.</p><p id="""">Annie observes that initially, caregiving can feel all-consuming because there are so many immediate needs. Over time, small steps toward independence may be made—perhaps the individual can assist with transfers or needs less help in the bathroom—but they still can’t manage tasks independently. The weight of responsibility remains squarely on the caregiver’s shoulders.</p><p id="""">Caregivers, Annie asserts, often find themselves exhausted, neglecting their own needs and grappling with overwhelming expectations and worries about how they can continue to manage everything.</p><p id="""">She works with patients and their families—sometimes separately, sometimes together—depending on their needs. While Annie doesn’t do formal couples counseling, she does help couples navigate life together after a brain injury, exploring how to adapt to this new reality as partners. Both the patient and their family often face profound, unanswerable questions.</p><p id="""">Every brain injury is unique, and so is every recovery. Annie explains that someone with a minor head injury might struggle more than someone with a more severe injury—it’s unpredictable. No two journeys are the same, with the extraordinary challenges of facing so many unknowns and the anxiety that uncertainty can create.<strong id="""">‍</strong></p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">Voices </strong>asked Annie to identify some Dharma concepts driving her patient interactions. Annie highlighted four areas:</h5><ul id=""""><li id="""">Present moment—focusing on what is here right now as an anchor in the process of letting go of their past identity and fears about who they will be in the future. </li><li id="""">Self-compassion—offering themselves kindness, patience, and realistic expectations in all those difficult moments.</li><li id="""">Calm—working with their breath so that they can pause the momentum of agitation and anxiety. Mindful breath is a somatic experience that allows them to reset the nervous system. </li><li id="""">Awareness of clinging—discerning what is within their control and knowing when they're holding on to something beyond their control. This prepares them for letting go of needing control over what they cannot change. </li></ul><blockquote id="""">""All of this is the Dharma, but I don’t use that vocabulary with my patients. Clients have different religious affiliations. The Dharma is full of psychology—Buddhist psychology. As Jesse says, the Dharma is the nature of things. And it's in the nature of human behavior to cling to our sense of self-identity.<strong id="""">‍</strong></blockquote><p id=""""><strong id="""">PRESENT MOMENT</strong>‍</p><p id="""">Annie emphasizes the importance of <em id="""">Present Moment Awareness</em> in her counseling, helping her patients recognize how often the mind drifts away from the present. <em id="""">“We catch ourselves floating to the future,”</em><strong id=""""> </strong>she explains,<strong id=""""> </strong><em id="""">“caught up in what-ifs and worst-case scenarios, or we get pulled back to the past, revisiting trauma, questioning what could have been done differently. This takes us out of the present moment. We can't be grounded when we’re lost in the unknown future or trying to rewrite the past. Instead, we get stuck in cycles of worry, anxiety, and depression.”</em></p><p id="""">Annie works with patients dealing with physical, speech, and motor impairments and the emotional weight that often accompanies these challenges. During their initial sessions, she asks a grounding question: <em id="""">“What’s the biggest challenge you’re facing right now?”</em> Their answers frequently revolve around the fear of the “unknowns.”</p><p id="""">This is when Annie introduces an essential teaching of the Dharma: impermanence. She notes that patients often view their conditions as permanent or static, expressing fears that things won’t improve. Annie offers them a new perspective: <strong id=""""><em id="""">“Can you focus on getting through this moment just for right now—without worrying about the future? You don’t have to figure out your entire life in this moment. All you need to do is face this one moment.”</em></strong>‍</p><p id="""">This simple yet profound reframing often brings an immediate sense of relief. Patients feel a weight lifted, realizing they don’t need to carry the burden of predicting or controlling the future. While they remain curious about how their rehabilitation journey will unfold, Annie helps them see that jumping ahead mentally isn’t helpful. Instead, they begin to appreciate the value of staying present, one moment at a time.<strong id="""">‍</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">SELF COMPASSION</strong>‍</p><p id="""">Annie describes how self-compassion often feels foreign to people. We are often raised to prioritize others, put others' needs first, and take responsibility for other people’s emotions. Annie creates an environment where patients can shift this mindset. Through multi-disciplinary therapy sessions, patients share their experiences, fostering both self-compassion and empathy for one another.</p><p id="""">Annie also introduces her patients to the science behind their struggles. <em id="""">“The nervous system,”</em> she explains, <em id="""">“gets agitated when we think about giving ourselves compassion. It feels awkward, even unsettling.”</em> She normalizes this reaction and offers practical strategies to ease into self-kindness. One such strategy is reframing: <em id="""">“Imagine this recovery was happening to your best friend. What would you say to them? Can you say those same words to yourself?”</em>‍</p><p id="""">For many, this exercise is deeply emotional. Some feel awkward, and others are moved to tears, but Annie observes the shift. <em id="""">“They see the change,”</em> she notes. <em id="""">“And I see it too. Self-compassion begins to feel possible.”</em> Through this work, patients gradually learn to offer themselves the grace and understanding they would so readily give to someone else.<strong id="""">‍</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">CALMING</strong>‍</p><p id="""">Annie integrates psychoeducation into her trauma work with patients recovering from brain injuries, addressing the profound disruption these injuries cause to their lives. She speaks openly about grief, helping patients recognize and process the loss of their previous way of life. A crucial part of her work involves teaching patients to cultivate stillness and calm, which allows for a deeper understanding of their experiences. To support this, Annie introduces somatic breathing exercises and other modalities to help patients find moments of calm, observe fears without being consumed by them, and regain a sense of stability in both heart and mind.</p><p id="""">The challenges Annie’s patients face extend far beyond their physical recovery. Many grapple with complex psychosocial issues such as homelessness, strained relationships, financial insecurity due to an inability to work, or the need to rely on temporary housing during recovery. Addiction can further complicate their situations, and despite the motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles, they often find themselves surrounded by others who are unsupportive of change. Annie works to address these layered difficulties with empathy and practical guidance.</p><p id="""">When it comes to calming techniques, Annie starts gently, tailoring her approach to each patient’s comfort and capacity. <em id="""">“I’ll begin with a couple of minutes of focusing on the breath,”</em> she explains. <em id="""">“We practice noticing the breath, acknowledging that thoughts will rise and pass, and then gently returning attention to the breath.”</em> She observes that responses vary: some patients experience agitation, opening their eyes, or beginning to talk, while others can stay with the practice for longer periods. For those with significant physical impairments, such as numbness or paralysis from a stroke, she avoids starting with body-based awareness exercises, as these sensations may be difficult or distressing. Breath meditation, however, is an accessible starting point and a consistent anchor that patients can return to.</p><p id="""">Chronic pain is a common challenge for many of Annie’s patients, particularly those suffering from migraines. For these individuals, Annie often recommends frequent practice of calming techniques and resources like the meditation app <em id="""">Headspace</em>. She notes that patients frequently report these meditation practices are more effective than any medication they’ve tried.</p><p id="""">One of Annie’s go-to strategies is adapted from mindfulness teacher Jon Kabat-Zinn’s <em id="""">Coming to Your Senses</em> exercise, commonly called the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. Patients are guided to ground themselves by identifying five things they can see, four things they can touch, three they can hear, two they can smell, and one they can taste. Annie explains establishing calm anchors patients in the present moment, pulling them out of the anxiety of an uncertain future. <em id="""">“All of these things are real and happening right now,”</em> she maintains. <em id="""">“It connects them to a sense of calm and the here and now.”</em>‍</p><p id="""">Through these practices, Annie offers her patients tools for managing the physical and emotional toll of their recovery and finding moments of peace amidst their challenges.<strong id="""">‍</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">AWARENESS</strong>‍</p><p id="""">When addressing everything outside a patient’s control—such as the unchangeable past—Annie takes time to help them focus on what they <em id="""">can</em> control. She calls this discernment—the difference between what lies within one’s power and what does not.</p><p id="""">In therapy, Annie redirects their focus when patients express frustration over what they can no longer do. She explores what they <em id="""">can</em> do in the present, even if it means approaching tasks differently. She often asks, <em id="""">“Can different be okay, just for today? Not for the rest of your life—just for today.”</em> Together, they discuss and practice the modifications introduced in therapy, helping patients reframe their perspective. Annie emphasizes, <em id="""">“Different can be okay.”</em>‍</p><p id="""">After 24 years of providing rehabilitation psychotherapy, Annie understands that recovery is a slow and deliberate process. She explains the concept of building new neural pathways through repeated attempts to do something—physically or through visualization. <em id="""">“These pathways grow very slowly,”</em> she tells her patients. <em id="""">“But if you attempt something 10,000 times, eventually, you’re going to succeed. You’re creating a new groove.”</em> Patients often come to recognize the fruits of their efforts, telling her, <em id="""">“Thank you for encouraging me to do this over and over.”</em> The moment they realize they are making progress—taking steps they once thought impossible—hope and possibility emerge.</p><p id="""">Annie connects this process of repetition to the practice of Dharma, where cultivating new ways of being happens gradually, with patience and faith in the process. However, she acknowledges the challenge of letting go. Patients often cling to their old identity, longing for how life used to be. <em id="""">“Letting go is hard,”</em> she says. <em id="""">“But it’s essential for growth.”</em>‍</p><p id="""">She teaches her patients that surrendering to what is out of their control is not the same as giving up. She reassures them: <em id="""">“You’re still fighting for recovery by focusing on what you can do. Surrendering means accepting what you cannot change while putting your energy into what you can.”</em> Annie recognizes a profound turning point in recovery when patients approach this place of surrender.</p><blockquote id=""""><em id="""">“I call it the beautiful place. It’s when patients reach the point where they say, ‘I can’t do it anymore,’ and they break down. They’re crying, and everything feels like a mess. I hold space for them in that moment, letting it all unfold. Then, we begin to talk about what makes this so difficult—the attachment to how things were before.”</em>‍</blockquote><p id="""">Annie helps her patients realize that their deepest struggle is not just the physical impairments caused by the brain injury but also their attachment to memories of their life before the injury. When they begin to release that attachment, Annie sees new growth. She believes that it’s in these moments that true recovery begins.<strong id="""">‍</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Voices asked Annie how working with people in such challenging circumstances impacts her Dharma practice.</strong></p><p id=""""><em id="""">""My Dharma practice has evolved since the beginning of working with this population; I didn't know how challenging this work could be and how horrible patient's stories could be. Early on, I didn’t know how much people's injuries would change their lives and impact their normalcy. At times, I was emotionally overwhelmed and moved to tears, which wasn't helping the patient. &nbsp;</em></p><p id=""""><em id="""">Now, with my mindfulness practice, I can have more awareness of what's rising and passing in me. And I can be compassionate and more authentic as a therapist who is also a human being. When my eyes well up when someone else's does, I can stay present with them and myself.""</em><br><br></p><p id=""""><a href=""https://view.flodesk.com/emails/67051ce8daff3dc117574f3c"">→Back to Voices Magazine</a></p><p id="""">‍<a href=""https://www.rootedinmindfulness.org/team/annie-repaci"" id="""">See Annie Repaci Bio Here</a></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p>"

With perseverance, we push through the chill of uncertainty, face existential hazards, and resiliently grow in body and spirit.</p><p id="""">Much like the caribou, we respond to a calling—a clear directive that promises health and fulfillment. We accept the call and follow an unshakable inner compass, braving obstacles and uncertainties. We, too, return to our source of direction and strength, embracing the risks inherent in our mission to transform and cultivate a good life. We find resiliency and renewal in an interplay of returning and becoming. </p><p id="""">Like the caribou, our inner requisite to fulfill a calling and live out our values accordingly—outweighs all fears of disrupting our certainty about what is needed to thrive.

During a RIM Zoom meditation, we were asked to notice the felt sense of being mindful. I don’t remember the exact words, but these phrases are etched in my mind.</p><blockquote id="""">Bring the breath to the front of your mindfulness awareness. Everything else is arising and passing away in the background. Be aware of every sight, sound, taste, touch, smell, and thought without clinging to or chasing after any of it.</blockquote><p id="""">Recognizing the felt sense of being mindful has been so helpful to me. It is difficult to describe a felt sense, which does not conform to the boundaries of words. For me, the experience of being fully tuned into a meditation is very much akin to sailing the open ocean in the dark. </p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/66ea07c77be4c185af07aeb5_66ea07b594c271989dd3b63b_Image%2520for%2520Chirstine%2527s%2520Article.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><blockquote id="""">I lived most of a decade on Windbourne, a 34-foot sailboat. I learned a bit about paying attention to everything at once, which is very much like the attention we cultivate in meditation. It is an attention that is simultaneously focused and diffuse, relaxed and fully attuned.</blockquote><p id="""">Like each of us, the ship herself is a mindful arrangement of many pieces of equipment designed to perform reliably in changing conditions. This six-ton sailboat simply floats until the sails are raised and properly trimmed. When everything is attuned, the ship seems to rise a bit and leap forward. In heavy seas with swells taller than her mast, the ship resolutely presses up the side of swells and surfs down the other side with abandon. It is very like the way we mindfully face challenges. </p><p id="""">Oceans cover much of the earth’s surface, with a vastness that defies oral description. Above the ship and sea is the sky … an incalculable volume of space. The stars hint at the vastness that dwarfs the ocean. The ship is but a speck. When the ship, the ocean, and the sky converge, there is often a magical moment of perfect attention for the sailor, which is similar to the kind of attention we cultivate in meditation ... focused and diffuse, relaxed and fully attuned.</p><p id="""">When sailing in the dark, the helmsman is aware of everything, but attention does not linger on any single element. Fixing the gaze on one object would risk missing new things emerging from the darkness. All six senses are online and attuned to subtle changes. So there is this steady, vigilant watching of everything in the field. Phenomena arise from a pervasive darkness and disappear just as quickly. While the helmsman knows where she is, there is no real sense of what will arise in the next instant and only a vague interest in what has already passed. The felt sense of this attention is familiar to the meditator in me.</p><p id="""">When my meditation is full of distraction, I often visualize myself on that sailboat &nbsp;… moving through an ocean, carried by the wind through time and space. When mindfulness is established, there is a felt sense of my heart rising and expanding. I watch, with curiosity, as things arise from an unknowable field of possibility and fade away. This ocean of attention to the present moment connects me to all that exists. There is a felt sense of joy on a grand scale.</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><a href=""http://www.rootedinmindfulness.org/team/christine-jacobi"" id="""">See Christine's Bio Here</a></p><p id=""""><a href=""https://view.flodesk.com/emails/66985be29421fee2c6504b0b"" id="""">→Back to Voices Community Connections</a></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p>"

Just as nature prunes away what no longer serves, so too must we let go of outdated beliefs, identities, and attachments. This is not a loss but an invitation to flourish. It is an opportunity to unlearn so that we may relearn, to unbecome so that we may become.</p><p id="""">Franciscan Friar, Richard Rohr, describes midlife as a threshold - a necessary passage from the first half of life to the second. The first half of life is about building the container of our identity. It is a time of striving, seeking security, and proving ourselves. But eventually, for those willing to listen, an inner shift begins. The second half of life is no longer about building, but about expanding and deepening. It is a time to move beyond ego, beyond external validation, and into a more authentic, soulful existence.</p><blockquote id="""">Midlife is not about reinvention, it is about remembering. It is a homecoming, a return to the essence of who we were before the world shaped us. Just as spring reveals the earth’s endless cycle of renewal, midlife reminds us of our own capacity to grow and flourish.</blockquote><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/67d744f9e74579b6929919d0_RIMphoto2.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">But how do we navigate this transition? It starts with reflection. We all have a beginning. And in the beginning, before the demands of adulthood, before the expectations of relationships and conditioning of the world, there was a time when we were simply ourselves - curious, present, and whole.</p><blockquote id="""">Who were you before the world got its hands on you?</blockquote><p id="""">This is one of my favorite questions to ask clients who are in the throes of midlife transition. It is an invitation to excavate the Self (with a capital S), the part of us buried under cultural expectations, family narratives, and layers of life experience. </p><p id="""">When we begin this work, we learn to frame midlife not as a crisis but rather, as Chip Conley describes, a chrysalis - a transformation that calls us to shed outdated beliefs, reorient our values, and step into a renewed sense of purpose. Here, we find clarity and empowerment to choose what we hold onto and what we release, thus curating the soil for our new growth.</p><blockquote id="""">Who were you before the world told you who to be?</blockquote><p id="""">Midlife is a time to cultivate this wisdom, to pause and ask: Am I living in alignment with my deepest values? Mindfulness teaches us to embrace impermanence, to be fully present with the unfolding of our lives rather than clinging to what was. </p><p id="""">Similarly, the Buddha taught that when we stop resisting change, we find freedom. True freedom comes from welcoming possibility and opening ourselves to the mystery unfolding within us, between us, and all around us.</p><p id="""">The transition into the second half of life is often initiated by a deep sense of dissatisfaction with what once fulfilled us. But rather than resisting this shift, we are called to surrender to it - to trust that what is falling away is making space for something deeper, more meaningful. </p><p id="""">Like the earth in spring, we, too, have the power to renew, to cultivate richer soil for our next stage of life. What will you shed? What will you nurture? What new growth is waiting to emerge?</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatleft""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/67d745175584a2a5125942e8_RIMphoto1.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">May you embrace the unfolding of midlife with mindfulness, surrendering to the expansion that awaits you.</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.rootedinmindfulness.org/team/jennifer-van-rossum"" id="""">See Jennifer's Bio</a></p><p id=""""><a href=""https://view.flodesk.com/emails/678580d2d5d7fadb7af01cdf"" id=""""><strong id="""">→Back to Voices Community Magazine</strong></a></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p>"

The Dharma teachings on Wise Speech encourage us to question our habitual ways of speaking. We look anew at our speech - recognizing what arises from the conditioned nature of our disposition, our intentions for harmony and goodwill, the value of truth, and the kindness of time-appropriate response.

It's Contagious,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">With Pat Jensen and Eldon Swenson</strong></p><p id="""">Pat Jensen and Eldon Swenson sat down with <strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices</em></strong> to talk about their meditation practice and shared interest in energy healing. Pat and Eldon exuded the comfort and ease of long-time partners, but that was not the real story. Their lives merged in 2015 when they volunteered to share energy healing practices with cancer patients. Their individual stories suggest that long before they joined RIM in 2019, they were already traveling the Dharma path. &nbsp;</p><p id="""">Before we hear their story, it might be productive to describe energy healing. Energy Healing is an ancient practice that facilitates a positive change in the way energy moves through the body to reduce the symptoms of pain, depression, and anxiety -- suffering. From a research perspective, there are both critics and defenders. Improving energy flow is fairly mysterious, but the results are quite real and often profound. Many patients report positive outcomes, so proof may be a moot point. &nbsp;</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/6732b585741cbb26be882b14_6732b575d6c68d231ec9b096_eldon%2520%2526%2520pat%2520reiki.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Eldon described one of his energy healing practices, Reiki, in this way:</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">In some oriental philosophies, we're all bathed in universal energy or life force. Our chakras are the way that the life force connects to our body. Disease is basically a result of one of the chakras being blocked, our body getting out of balance. </em></strong></blockquote><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">I believe in the impressive impact of touch. I tell patients that our minds and bodies can unconsciously communicate, activating our internal healing abilities to self-heal. This explanation was comfortable for me and made sense to my patients. I didn't need a more complex explanation other than the value of touch.</em></strong></blockquote><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Pat’s Path</strong></h4><p id="""">Pat’s interest in caring for seriously ill and dying patients began with the death of her father when she was 15 years old. Her father had been a medic in World War II.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">He had been with many men who died during the war. And it changed his life. He had a calm and dignified manner during his own dying process that showed me how to be around people who were in the process of dying. I've always felt that Dad was my first hospice patient. In my nursing program, I decided to do hospice work. </em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">After marrying and having five children, Pat entered a nursing program at Northern Michigan University. When her husband was transferred to Wisconsin, Pat enrolled at Cardinal Stritch College and earned a degree in theology. This is where her interest in Buddhism began.&nbsp;When Pat finished her degree in 1994, her interest in meditative practices emerged. She then took a job with the Sisters of St. Francis at Cardinal Stritch College. One of the young sisters invited Pat to attend a lecture in Madison on the healing process.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">And that was it! The lecture triggered something in me. I have a nursing and theology background. That lecture sparked my interest in a program called Healing Touch. It put all the pieces together, and it still amazes me to this day. </em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">With all that enthusiasm, Pat enrolled in a Healing Touch program at UWM supported by the American Nursing Association and eventually finished her 3-year training in Florida. Though a medical background was not required, Pat, as an LPN, used her medical training to enhance her Healing Touch program experience.</p><p id="""">Healing Touch, like Reiki, works through the chakras. Anatomically, the entire nervous system moves down the center of the body through a series of chakras. There are seven chakras, each with a specific function. With practice, the practitioners learn to see and feel blocked chakras. They move their hands over a person’s body to determine which chakra is blocked. &nbsp;Reiki and Healing Touch open the blocked chakra, giving the patient more energy and making them feel better.</p><p id="""">Before finishing the Healing Touch program, Pat’s first husband, Bill, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease. While caring for Bill during his 10-year illness, Pat rekindled a long-standing interest in the common threads of many religious philosophies. Her interest settled on exploring Buddhism.</p><p id="""">After Pat’s husband passed away in 2014, she felt a need to “find herself again because you lose yourself as a caregiver.” During Pat’s search, friends encouraged her to volunteer at a nearby cancer center. Pat took their advice and made an appointment with the mentor to discuss a Reiki program. That mentor was Eldon Swenson.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Eldon’s Path</strong></h4><p id="""">Eldon grew up in a small farming community with a stoic acceptance of life’s hardships and death. When Eldon became interested in Buddhist authors, he was surprised by the assumption that humans struggle to accept and embrace impermanence.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">As a doctor, I'm not upset by a patient being near death. That just doesn't bother me. And I think that lack of fear transfers. Reiki allowed me to focus on that one person. Patients know that for one hour, they have the undivided attention of someone comfortable with their difficult medical circumstances. In that 45-60 minutes, I could see them expanding beyond the confines of their illness. </em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">Eldon had always been interested in cultivating a supportive environment for patients. About a year after becoming a practicing anesthesiologist, he realized people were terrified of surgery. To address this fear, he started putting his hand on their shoulders. He asked them to imagine themselves relaxing in a warm bathtub, and he'd play classical music. After changing how he interacted with patients, a recovery nurse explained that his patients were waking up differently. They were more comfortable and experienced less pain and nausea. She wanted to know what he was doing differently. Knowing it made a positive difference, Eldon administered anesthesia with a gentle touch and reassurance for 39 years. </p><p id="""">During his career, Eldon spent a year teaching pediatric anesthesia on a university faculty. When dealing with frightened children, the traditional response was to put them to sleep quickly. Very often, these children woke up with nightmares and general distress. Eldon initiated the practice of holding and calming the child while administering anesthesia. The outcomes were noticeably positive. After a while, all of the faculty started using those strategies.</p><p id="""">Much later, Eldon realized these gentle additions to the anesthesia process were versions of energy healing. When Eldon was 70 years old and disenchanted with retirement, he sought a meaningful way to spend his time. At first glance, Reiki sounded crazy. He reluctantly agreed to a 4-hour training program. Still not a believer, he tried it on his wife for her fear of flying and his neighbor for her terror of <em id="""">redo</em> surgery. Amazing results! He has since used reiki with about 350 cancer patients. This simple practice of quiet touching yielded profound relief from anxiety and other suffering related to living with a cancer diagnosis.</p><p id="""">Eldon described his first Reiki patient:</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">She was just a little thing under a pile of blankets. And she was dying of pancreatic cancer and had a lot of pain. I went over and saw her lying all curled up under these blankets. So I did Reiki over the blankets and touched her feet. After 45 minutes, she looked up at me with these little eyes and said, “All my worries went away.” Isn't that wonderful? I almost cried at that point. </em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">Eldon described an impactful moment early in his career as a Reiki practitioner, doing a Reiki session with a woman: </p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">I can visualize it. I had both my hands on her leg. And it was almost like I heard the voice, “This precious person.” At that moment, I realized that if I were offered a million dollars to stop doing Reiki on this woman, I would turn it down. I wanted to be right there more than any place in the world. I began seeing similarities between my Reiki and anesthesia practices over the years. I realized I'd been doing ‘touch healing’ for my entire career.</em></strong></blockquote><p id=""""><strong id="""">Eldon and Pat’s Shared Path</strong></p><p id="""">Pat and Eldon met in 2015. Eldon was the mentor responsible for training new volunteers to provide Reiki to surgical patients at a cancer center. Having both lost spouses in the same year, they were interested in sharing their interests and talents, and energy healing was the common thread. Ah! The stars were aligned. Everything that had happened to them brought them to this shared moment. Their common interests and personal experiences resonated with each other.</p><p id="""">Pat and Eldon married in 2019. A dear friend with end-stage cancer was upset that she probably would not live to see them get married. With a shrug of their shoulders, Pat and Eldon arranged to be married in this friend’s home. It was an awesome celebration of a life well lived!</p><p id="""">After about a year in their new home, Pat and Eldon created a meditation room and committed to developing a meditation practice. They practiced silent meditation, read spiritual literature, and explored Buddhist websites. Eldon and Pat were essentially merging their Christian practice with Buddhism. However, their daily meditation sessions gradually began to fizzle out a bit. </p><p id="""">They crossed RIM’s threshold in early 2020, a bit before COVID forced RIM to shift to a Zoom-only format. Today (2024), they are still active members of the RIM community as regular participants in multiple sessions each week and as volunteers. Eldon reflects:</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">When Pat and I started a meditation practice, it felt a lot like doing Reiki. Meditation, Healing Touch, and Reiki have changed my unconscious mind in ways that I don't fully understand. It made my life more balanced. And I was more open to RIM as a result of my experience with Reiki.</em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">When <strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices</em></strong> asked if Reiki practitioners were ‘special,' Eldon emphatically said that all humans have this capacity to facilitate energy healing.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">I view Reiki as a different version of the calm we practice at RIM. Much of what we discuss at RIM starts with calm, so I believe that 100 percent of people have the capacity to calm themselves and access their own self-healing. We learn how to water those seeds of calmness and develop equanimity.</em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">Pat echoed Eldon’s conviction. When Voices asked, ‘Who is doing the healing?’ &nbsp;Both Pat and Eldon emphatically said that the patient does the healing, and the Reiki practitioner is the conduit of that energy.</p><p id="""">Pat and Eldon still practice Reiki on each other, on sick neighbors, a couple of people from an alcoholics anonymous group, and friends. </p><p id="""">Pat ended our conversation with her daily ritual of reciting the Five Lines, which connected her way of living, her practice at RIM, and her practice using Reiki and Healing Touch.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">I am grateful for this new day. I embrace impermanence. I cultivate compassion for myself and others. I walk the path of wisdom. I’m at peace with myself. Blessings to everyone! &nbsp;Share your calmness. &nbsp;It is contagious.</em></strong></blockquote><p id=""""><a href=""https://view.flodesk.com/emails/67051ce8daff3dc117574f3c"" id="""">→Back to Voices Magazine</a></p><p id=""""><a href=""http://www.rootedinmindfulness.org/team/pat-jensen"" id="""">See Pat's Bio</a></p><p id=""""><a href=""http://www.rootedinmindfulness.org/team/eldon-swenson"" id="""">See Eldon's Bio</a></p><p id=""""><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AOt6htH68GBAinm2fgPgFa75EmlKTOrnn5oM6MyuRfQ/edit?usp=sharing"">LINK to Energy Healing Resources recommended by Pat and Eldon</a> </p>"

At about the same time, Susanne Adams sat with Voices to talk about the intersection between her mindfulness practice and her job responding to wildfires for the National Forest Service. </p><p id="""">We’ve all seen pictures of firefighters with wildfires raging around them. The public often views these firefighters as heroes, but Susanne balks at the glorification of being a wildland firefighter. In a moment of introspection, Susanne said:</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">I really like it. My ego likes it. I've always wanted to be considered cool,' and I get a little hit of that most times when I talk to people about being a wildland firefighter. It is a continual work to be mindful of this reaction and think about where it stems from. What part of that reaction is healthy and unhealthy? I don't have that answer, but I muse on that.” Beyond that, Susanne says, “We choose to do this job; we are very aware of the risks, and we are just doing the job.</em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">Like many of us, our careers revolve around things we enjoy. Susanne has confronted the more challenging aspects of nature and unanticipated disasters, but she believes most everyone is better off spending time in nature.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Lisa, my wife, and I find real beauty in a swamp. We're flipping 55 years old, and we've been in the woods almost every day for years. You know, we're still in awe of nature. It sometimes just astounds you.</em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">Susanne began her career with the Forest Service as a Wildlife Biologist. Very early in that career, Susanne voluntarily joined the wildland firefighting effort, an additional aspect of her work with the Forest Service. In addition to responding to wildfires, these teams are called when disaster conditions outstrip the local resources. For example, teams responded to the space shuttle Challenger debris recovery, 911 response, hurricane relief, and a bird flu outbreak. </p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatleft""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/66dc548531dadfc1ddd2f333_66dc5480925e8c675c624637_Susanne%2520in%2520Action%25202.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">In 2005, Susanne shifted gears from being an engine and dozer boss to becoming a facilities unit leader.

The caterer alone might arrive with six or more semi-trailers with food, a mobile kitchen, food prep, and serving space.</p><p id="""">She talked about the day she decided to switch gears from actively fighting fires to organizing the response. She stood with her team, watching a wildfire crest the top of a hill.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">I was a dozer boss then and wasn’t on board with the current plan. You know, my mouth was all dry; I was scared. At that moment, I realized I didn’t need to be on the fire line if I didn’t feel comfortable with the assignments they were giving me. Still, it was a difficult decision. I still had close ties to my team in the fire environment. We all had a common mission, and we worked together on it. So there is this real team camaraderie thing that happens. I enjoyed working with people closely like that in intense situations to accomplish this common goal.</em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">When asked how her meditation practice might have influenced that kind of decision, Susanne said her mediation practice only began about ten years ago. While she admitted her job was ‘pretty stressful,’ meditation was part of a more holistic effort to address some health issues and a long-standing interest in meditation.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Meditation was one of those things that I had on my list for a long time. I thought it was something good to do, along with a good diet and exercise. You know, all those ‘take care of yourself’ things. But it took three to five years for my meditation practice to stick.</em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">When Susanne moved to the Milwaukee area, she decided to get serious about establishing a meditation practice. She’d been using meditation apps consistently but wanted to improve her practice significantly.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">That was my goal. I set that intention. And so I talked to some people, I did internet searches. I narrowed it down to three places, of which RIM was one. Some places were much closer to my home, but I planned to visit all of them. I went to RIM first, and I never left. I’ve always felt really blessed to find RIM and enjoy my time with this community, but now I'm farther away and unable to be there in person more often. But, it's just a wonderful organization. My life, way of dealing with people, and head space have all been the better for it.</em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">When time is at a premium in stressful circumstances, Susanne says she has many meditation practices she can use on the fly. When she finds a lull in the action, she reminds herself that she has no urgent or immediate thing that needs to be taken care of.<strong id=""""> </strong></p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Susanne converts what she calls ‘snippets of space’ into mini meditations</strong>. </h4><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">I just take opportunities as they come to me. Holistic practice helps me handle that stress better. It helps me handle other people's stress and anxiety better. I have improved how I navigate stress within myself and others.”\</em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">Like all of us, bringing our practice into the workplace can be challenging. Susanne openly admitted that there were times when she and her team really excelled and times when they struggled. Susanne shared a story about a time when her team was struggling to get the resources needed to support teams of firefighters. When someone lambasted her in front of a large group of coworkers, Susanne noticed the fruit of her practice. She acknowledged the truth in his accusations. She offered no excuses but tried to calmly explain what was happening behind the scenes with the supply chain.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Meditation also helps me feel more empathy for all the people I'm working with and the public we interact with. I interact with a fair bit of private vendors and landowners, and they’re sometimes agitated, clearly upset, or concerned about something. It’s difficult to maintain a sense of calm, at least a sense of calmer, in a high-stress, emotionally charged situation.</em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">Susanne says her meditation practice has helped her navigate emotionally charged situations much more smoothly than in the past. It gave her more tools for dealing with the inevitable conflicts, increasing her awareness of how the other person feels and being more aware of her own emotional responses.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">I come into these situations with more kindness and more empathy. I’m more open about my personal limitations and am more open to those conversations.</em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">The members of these disaster response teams come from varied backgrounds, training, and years of experience. Joining a larger disaster response team can be a difficult transition. Everyone comes to the scene with their own style. While Susanne recognizes the positive impact of her mindfulness training, people don’t always respond positively to positive intentions. This is not a surprise, but it can be emotionally devastating. Susanne gave a few examples.</p><p id="""">When responding to a hurricane, teams of firefighters from many locations were housed in a school. Classrooms were used to provide living spaces for teams, but there were not enough rooms for all individual teams to have their own space. Multiple teams were all assigned living space in a gym. Prejudices arose, tempers flared, and unfounded accusations were made. Susanne felt responsible for making this situation more acceptable to all groups. After days of everyone complaining about their accommodations in the gym, Susanne finally found a way to move one of the Hispanic crews into a classroom. She felt good about finding a way to help their team, only to be approached by a Human Resources representative who said the crew had filed a complaint against her. They accused her of being racist by trying to shove them out of sight. Sometimes, even the best intentions are not well received.</p><p id="""">In another situation, Susanne was struggling to work with a transgender firefighter who “just came in with a chip on her shoulder and caused a lot of drama. She seemed determined to find people wronging her. Because she was looking for that, that’s what she found.” As a gay woman with a wife and family, Susanne was invested in helping her coworker recognize the difference between intentional disdainful treatment and those ‘oops moments created simply by mistake. Despite her best efforts, Susanne was acutely aware that tensions remained steady. </p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">When people get in stressful situations, it just gets dicey sometimes. And so, yes, meditation helps me navigate those situations. It’s taking those snippets of space I find during the day and using them to meditate. Overall, the practice helps me walk into those emotionally charged situations with my eyes more open than before. They're just more open.</em></strong></blockquote><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><a href=""http://www.rootedinmindfulness.org/team/susanne-adams"" id="""">See Susanne's Bio Here</a></p><p id=""""><a href=""https://view.flodesk.com/emails/66985be29421fee2c6504b0b"">→Back to Voices Community Connections</a></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p>"

We want to learn more about the beautiful, dharma-inspired jewelry you've created for RIM community members for over a decade. We’re interested in your creation process. </em></p><p id=""""><em id="""">Let's start with what inspires you to create jewelry that reflects and supports dharma practice if it indeed does.</em></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Cindy:</em></strong> As a child, I was drawn to stones. Every summer, we would spend three weeks in July camping in the Black Hills, Yellowstone, or the Grand Tetons. I liked to find different colored stones and collect them. My parents would stop for me at every rock shop along the highway. Nothing pleased me more than a little bag of stones I could carry in my pocket.<br></p><p id="""">I spent weeks in the summer in Wisconsin with my maternal grandmother. She would take me to John Muir County Park, where we'd look for arrowheads and other stones. My grandmother lived in Montello, a place known for the hardest granite in the world. She would have big canning jars filled with beautiful stones and water so that you could see their colors.</p><p id="""">Shortly after moving to Wisconsin, and while attending yoga classes, I had an opportunity to hear people speak about crystals. I took a few classes to learn about the types of crystals and how they were tied to the chakras. It was a very new-age environment, but I learned about the chakras in the body and how different crystals resonate with the energies in the body. It was a natural transition for me then to take this knowledge and passion of stone energies and start making jewelry so that I might wear the stones and benefit from their energy. <br></p><p id="""">One day, while passing a bead shop, I noticed a sign in the window that said, ""Come on in and make a free pair of earrings.""<em id=""""> </em>Inside the store, I saw large displays of gemstones and other beads. I thought, ""Oh my goodness, this is like a candy store for me."" I knew I could make necklaces, bracelets, and other jewelry from the stones I'd been collecting. I had been collecting stones and was very in tune with the body, the chakras, and the gemstones that supported <strong id="""">wellbeing</strong>. <br></p><p id="""">I started making jewelry and doing home shows to discuss which stones are suitable for opening chakras. People ordered jewelry with specific stones that could benefit them, a family member, or a friend. I would then create pieces that would hopefully be healing or beneficial to them, which, in turn, felt nourishing for me. </p><p id="""">When I became more involved in meditation at RIM, I discovered that stones could support my practice by helping with concentration. Holding specific stones in my hands helped me to feel grounded and open-hearted. People at RIM&nbsp;admired my jewelry, and I described how the stones or meditation messages helped me. People began to ask me to make jewelry for them. <br></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:</em></strong> <em id="""">When and why did you start your affiliation with RIM?</em></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Cindy:</em> </strong>My brother and sister-in-law, who live in Michigan, have been practicing Buddhists for many, many years. When they visited us, they looked for a place to meditate. My brother emailed and asked if I knew I had a meditation center two minutes from my house. I did not—RIM is the best-kept secret. I called and spoke with Jesse Foy, and it sounded like an interesting place, so I signed up for informational emails.<br></p><p id="""">One day, when our then-teenage son was in the hospital with serious medical issues, I was scrolling through my phone and saw an email from Rooted In Mindfulness about an upcoming Foundations of Mindfulness course. I needed this class so badly, so I signed up! I just knew that RIM was meant for me.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:</em></strong><em id=""""> Well, we’re certainly glad you found RIM!</em></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Cindy:</em></strong> Thank you. It's been wonderful to be part of this Sangha, for sure.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:</em></strong><em id=""""> Let's talk about your jewelry and how it relates to your practice. When creating your jewelry, do Buddhist practices influence you? What thoughts go through your mind when you create Dharma jewelry for people?</em></p><blockquote id="""">‍<strong id=""""><em id="""">Cindy:</em></strong><em id=""""> </em>Meditation is part of the jewelry-making process. When I create jewelry for a struggling family member or friend, I first look to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. First, I think of the body. Does this person need heart-opening, calm, peace, or a sense of safety? What stones would be helpful for grounding or opening? I select stones or pieces, put them in a crystal rose-quartz singing bowl, sit with them, and visualize the design.<br></blockquote><p id="""">I notice <strong id="""">feeling tones</strong> and my thoughts, and I think about my intention for a piece of jewelry. My body naturally becomes super calm and concentrated when working with the stones.<br></p><p id="""">I make ""Breathe"" bracelets and incorporate symbols like a Lotus in other pieces. I’ve also made Mala bracelets and necklaces to help people practice mantras or concentrate on their breath. I want whatever I make to represent and spread compassion, generosity, and love. <br></p><p id="""">I also like to connect the stones with the jewelry to make them appealing to wear. I want to create pieces that make people happy, too. I hope those who wear my jewelry feel the love that went into making it. </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:</em></strong> <em id="""">We all have jewelry that is a remembrance; when we put it on, we take a deep breath and relax. Do you talk to people about that at all?</em></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Cindy:</em></strong> People at RIM are already very in tune with breathwork, but at jewelry shows, like the <em id="""">Dare to Be Aware</em> event, I would display my jewelry in ways related to the chakras. I had a set of seven chakra stones for kids and talked about energy and how helpful each stone could be.<br></p><p id="""">I selected particular pieces of Dharma jewelry to offer to the RIM community. The leather bracelets with a metal stamped <em id="""">Breathe, Namaste, </em>and <em id="""">Love</em> were especially enjoyed by RIM friends. </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:</em></strong> <em id="""">Cindy, what have you heard from people you've made jewelry for? What stands out in your mind?</em></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Cindy:</em></strong> People have told me that they wear the jewelry often, that it's their favorite piece, and that they want me to make jewelry they can give to others. Hearing how well those people received it and knowing it was a piece made especially for them made me feel really good. The personalization makes the recipient enjoy it a little bit more.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3060px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3060px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/674f9a32f4ccfdb4e8593e45_674f9a2099334976ab333d4b_Nancy%25204.jpeg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:</em></strong><em id=""""> We recall your enthusiasm when you started making Dharma jewelry for the Sangha.

Their responses were so positive, and they asked, ""Can I get more of those to share with others?"" It made me so happy to be part of a group that found value in my Dharma jewelry.

You might say <em id="""">breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out</em>. As you move through each bead, you may say <em id="""">ease, calm — I'm breathing in calm</em>. So by the time you get around the 108 beads, you have had a 20-minute sit, and that's very good.<em id=""""> </em>People have been using beads for prayer and contemplation for thousands of years. </p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Voices:</em></strong> <em id="""">Is there anything else you'd like to share?</em></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Cindy:</em></strong> Thank you for asking me to share about my jewelry-making.

It’s a light that reveals the true nature of our experiences, helping us find understanding, well-being, and genuine happiness. But what exactly is insight?<br></p><p id="""">In our practice, insight is a deep and transformative understanding arising from our own mindfulness and the wakefulness it brings. Practically speaking, we can consider two types: practical and liberating insights. Practical insights are everyday realizations that help us navigate life with more awareness, understanding, ease, and skill. They might include recognizing the limitations of how we see ourselves, others, and the world, understanding the triggers behind our reactivity, or noticing how habitual behaviors limit our happiness. These practical insights benefit our daily lives, fostering wisdom and compassion and helping us live in ways that benefit ourselves, others, and our shared world.<br></p><p id="""">Liberating insights lead us to profound understandings of the nature of reality and our relationship to it. They reveal the impermanent, interconnected, and non-self aspects of our existence, guiding us toward lasting inner peace and liberation. Insights help us cultivate ""right view,"" changing how we see the world and helping us realize our innate Buddha nature. Insights are connected to, arise from, and grow our wakefulness.<br></p><p id="""">Both types of insight are available to us in our meditation and mindful living practice.

His professional path included degrees in biology, psychology, experimental psychology, and sociology. In the midst of all this, Chawki sat down in an interview with LoriLee Villwock and Christine Jacobi to talk about his experience as a greeter at RIM.</p><p id="""">Chawki was attracted to the role of greeter because he knew firsthand how isolated some people feel when joining a new group of people. He knew that felt sense of anxiety and separateness. Chawki self-identifies as a person who is “autistic by nature”, which left him feeling as though he was “plopped here on earth without a manual.”</p><p id="""">Chawki speculated that many newcomers arrive with worries about being accepted, with anxiety about doing something new, or with hopes that meditation will help them manage difficult features of their lives. With his own personal experiences and cultivated empathy, Chawki made the compassionate choice to actively try to make people at RIM feel welcomed and valued. He used phrases like “non-judgmental acceptance,” “walking together,” and “my heart reaches out to them” to describe this generous offering.</p><p id="""">Throughout the interview, Chawki continually eluded to the balance of giving and receiving. Leaning on his professional background, he cited the well-researched psychological benefits of volunteering and the value of expanding a base of like-minded friends. But Chawki lit up when he started talking about our shared responsibility to each other as we develop our practice.</p><h4 id="""">“As practitioners, you really can’t practice all that completely by yourself. &nbsp;You need the Sangha to facilitate a lot of your practice. You can’t really bloom into your practice unless you have other people, whether it’s in Dharma talks, whether it’s meaningful interactions, whether it’s seeing people smile back at you and welcome you to a space.” ~ Chawki<br></h4><p id="""">Extending himself, in an authentic way, as the first welcoming face when someone enters RIM, wasn’t totally in Chawki’s wheelhouse. Paradoxically, initiating meaningful conversation to foster a sense of belonging was a social skill that made Chawki a bit anxious. With a light-hearted laugh, Chawki said the responsibility of initiating conversation with strangers was initially like ""unfolding a rusty lawn chair."" Still, life is full of challenging situations, which are best met directly.</p><p id="""">While we might hope to arrive at a new volunteer position fully prepared, the needed skills usually develop gradually. Now, with many hours as a volunteer greeter, Chawki recalled how other greeters and the volunteer coordinator, Wendy, helped him “smooth out the process of engaging a stranger” so they felt like they belonged to the RIM community. The generous act of stepping outside his comfort zone to make someone else feel comfortable and welcomed, also resulted in his expanding sense of social ease and an expanding base of spiritual friends.</p><p id="""">Looking forward, Chawki hopes to move past a spontaneous offering of warmth and friendship toward a more intentional pattern of open-hearted welcoming. The intentional pattern may make more space for ‘those small moments when you are interacting in a really meaningful way”. &nbsp;</p><p id="""">To others thinking about volunteering, Chawki offered wonderful advice … “Be yourself, be prepared to grow, and recognize you can’t fully bloom into your Dharma practice alone … you need a Sangha.” In conclusion, Chawki returned to the concept of giving generously, saying, “We think of Dāna as giving financial support. Time, energy, and effort are Dāna, too.”</p><p id=""""><em id="""">This interview was edited and condensed for clarity and length.&nbsp;</em></p><p id=""""><a href=""https://www.rootedinmindfulness.org/team/chawki-belhadi"">See Chawki's Bio Here</a></p><p id=""""><a href=""https://view.flodesk.com/emails/65652d4676d8419ffa83d513"" id="""">→Back to Voices Community Connections</a></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p>"

So much has transpired during those 55 years. Change is the only constant feature. The link between my personal Dharma practice and the natural world strengthens with each passing year. Without that link, I have no Dharma practice at all.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/67c4db5d8d0c305167bbd718_3FD38CC9-D733-4F97-9D7F-C5C1CEC39F46.JPG"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">The ‘felt sense’ of being in nature has a dramatic impact on my Dharma practice. Though the sentiment is a bit different, I think of the words to <em id="""">Annie’s Song</em> by John Denver:</p><blockquote id="""">You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest, like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain, like a storm on the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean. You fill up my senses. Come fill me again.</blockquote><p id="""">Still, our relationship with nature is hard to define. We live in a consumer culture and human beings are at the top of the ‘food chain’. We often use Earth’s natural resources with little regard for Earth’s needs. Are human beings really in charge, or are we just fooling ourselves?</p><p id="""">Indigenous people assigned ‘personhood’ to the Earth, Sun, Moon, Rivers, Lakes, and a variety of living creatures. </p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatleft"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatleft""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/67c4dcbad496937cae38c76d_Screenshot%202025-03-02%20at%204.32.10%E2%80%AFPM.png"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">This resonates deeply with me. Intellectually, ‘personhood’ suggests <em id="""">sentience</em>, which is an ability to sense and respond to the sensations of seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting, or smelling. Creatively, I feel this might all occur outside the scope of traditional eyes, ears, skin, mouth, or nose. Philosophically, this expanded understanding of ‘personhood’ suggests that humans are just one part of life on Earth and that all beings (including the land, air, water and creatures) have rights that should be protected. </p><p id="""">It’s not difficult to imagine Earth as an individual person, fine-tuned to maintain a precise orbit, heating and cooling herself with weather, supporting a wide variety of living creatures to tend to her needs. We think we understand what Earth is. But do we?&nbsp;How could we grasp the reality of living over 4.5 billion years in a solar system so large it is measured in the number of light years it takes to cross it?</p><p id="""">The earth maintains her position in space so steadfastly, one has to wonder where the brains of Earth might be. Certainly the human brain could not manage all the intricate functions of Earth. Are Earth’s emotions centered in her magnetic core? Does Earth speak and hear with vibrational signals? Are Earth’s rivers, lakes and oceans her circulatory system? Are forests Earth’s lungs? Does Earth digest through the process of decomposition? Is our atmosphere the hand of Earth?</p><blockquote id="""">The earth laughs in flowers. &nbsp;<em id=""""><sub id="""">R.W.

We would keep her waters and air clean. We would honor the impressive role trees and plants play in converting carbon dioxide into oxygen. We would plant and harvest crops without poisoning Earth. We would stop drilling into Earth and blasting mountain tops right off her surface. &nbsp;</p><blockquote id="""">Our view of Earth as our servant may be one of our grandest delusions. </blockquote><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:4312px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""4312px""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/5c1d5875be406805d3bb99dd/67c4db8522809b497439a171_FB3C5945-3F5D-41CD-ACE3-4EFF83818B73.JPG"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""__wf_reserved_inherit"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">More realistically, we are guests in a symbiotic relationship with Earth.
