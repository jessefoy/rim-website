We need dedicated time—time to truly stop, to let the body unwind, to remember what it feels like to just be without the pressures of our to-dos and agendas. Time to move more slowly and to be fully present with ourselves. A Day of Mindfulness offers that kind of time: space to compassionately deepen our understanding of ourselves and care for ourselves with kindness.</p><p>This day is an opportunity for extended practice, rest, integration, and healing. It can support those who want to go deeper in their formal practice, and for those just beginning, it offers a supportive, guided introduction to meditation and mindful living.</p><h3>Noble Silence</h3><p>We spend most of the day in what's called ""noble silence."" It's not silence as a rule or restriction—it's silence undertaken with intention, as an act of care for ourselves and others. Without small talk, without phones, without needing to be ""on,"" something in us can settle. The mind grows quieter. The body relaxes. We can turn inward and listen more deeply to our own experience—and to this life we're living.</p><p>That listening is a gift: to ourselves, to those we love, and to the world we're part of.</p><h3>What the Day Includes</h3><p>You'll be gently guided throughout the day, with plenty of room for quiet, restful contemplation.</p><ul><li>Guided and silent sitting meditation</li><li>Walking meditation outdoors and/or indoors</li><li>A meal eaten together in silence—the comfort of community without the pressure to engage</li><li>Brief teachings and reflection</li><li>Time for rest and solitude in nature or in supportive indoor spaces</li><li>Optional dialogue near the end of the day to support integration</li></ul><h3>Who This Day Is For</h3><p>People come carrying all sorts of things—the momentum of their lives and the full spectrum of what it means to be human:</p><ul><li>Stress, grief, exhaustion, overwhelm</li><li>The weight of personal and societal pressures</li><li>A longing for healing, stillness, or rest</li><li>A desire to appreciate what is already well and healthy</li></ul><p>You don't need to arrive in any particular state. You're coming to be with your life more fully. Whatever brings you, you are welcome.</p><h3>What This Day Can Offer</h3><p>A&nbsp;Day of Mindfulness Retreat is gentle, yet profoundly supportive—and often deeply transformative. It can be a kind of medicine: not a way to ""fix"" ourselves, but a way to access our innate capacity to live with greater resilience, understanding, and compassion—for ourselves and others.</p><p>In that space, a healthier relationship with our minds and lives becomes even more possible. We grow our capacity to see the patterns that create unnecessary stress and suffering—and to loosen their grip. We learn to live in a more healing and integrated way.</p><p>By the end of the day, most people feel different. Not fixed—just more settled. More in their bodies. More connected. More able to remember and stay connected to what is important, well, and good. This is profoundly supportive of our intentions to live well and be happy.</p><h3>Open to Everyone</h3><p>This retreat welcomes newcomers and experienced practitioners alike. There's no pressure to do anything perfectly—you're coming to rest, and to be. All you need to do is show up to the fullness of yourself and your life.</p><p>The day includes a meal and refreshments.</p>","<h3>Location: Cedar Valley</h3><p>The retreat is held at<strong> </strong><a href=""https://ucci.org/cedar-valley/""><strong>Cedar Valley</strong></a><strong> - UCCI, 5349 Co Rd D, West Bend, WI 53090</strong>, a quiet setting of woods, prairies, a pond, trails, and more.

What a precious gift! We have the capacity to live in a way that these twenty-four hours will bring peace, joy, and happiness to ourselves and others.""",Thich Nhat Hanh,"<h3>About this Course</h3><p>We live in a time that asks a great deal of us. Many of us are carrying more than we realize—stress that has settled into our bodies, worry that colors our days, a sense of disconnection from ourselves and the people we love. We do our best to meet the demands of life, but something essential can get lost along the way. The practices in this course offer a way back to our greater intentions and how to live in harmony with them.</p><p>Mindfulness is the simple and profound act of being present—to ourselves, to each other, to life as it actually is. It is not an escape from difficulty, but a way of meeting it with greater clarity, steadiness, and care. </p><p>When we learn to be present, we begin to see more clearly. We respond rather than react. We discover resources within ourselves we didn't know we had. And we become more available—to our own lives and to the people who need us.</p><p><strong>Foundations of Mindful Living</strong> is a 4-week course offering a clear and practical path into meditation and mindful living. Whether you are new to practice or returning to strengthen your foundation, this course will give you what you need to begin—and to continue.</p><h3><strong>The Path We'll Walk Together</strong></h3><p>This course is grounded in the <strong>Mindfulness-Based C.A.R.E. Framework</strong>—a path of practice that moves from settling the mind and body, to seeing ourselves clearly, to living with intention and purpose.</p><ul><li>‍<strong>Calm &amp; Connect:</strong> We begin where all practice begins—by arriving. Learning to settle the nervous system, to find ground in the present moment, to come home to ourselves. This is the foundation. From a place of steadiness, everything else becomes possible.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Awareness &amp; Attitude:</strong> With some stillness established, we turn toward our experience with open eyes and hearts. We learn to observe our thoughts, emotions, and habits—not to judge them, but to understand. And we cultivate the attitude that makes this seeing healing rather than harsh: curiosity, patience, kindness toward ourselves.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Remember &amp; Reflect: </strong>Practice is not only what happens on the cushion. It is learning to remember presence in the midst of daily life—while walking, working, listening, and the full spectrum of life. And it is the art of reflection: looking at our lives honestly, discovering what matters, and understanding ourselves more deeply.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Embody &amp; Engage:</strong> Finally, we bring what we have cultivated into the world. We learn to embody presence in our bodies and our actions. We engage with difficulty without being swept away. And we offer the fruit of our practice to those we love and to the wider world that needs our clarity and care.</li></ul><h3><strong>What You Will Cultivate</strong></h3><ul><li>A sustainable meditation practice you can carry forward for a lifetime.</li><li>The capacity to meet stress, difficulty, and strong emotions with greater skill.</li><li>A quality of presence that transforms ordinary moments—and your relationships.</li><li>The understanding that your own well-being and the well-being of others are not separate.</li></ul><h3><strong>Who This Is For</strong></h3><p>This course is for anyone who senses that a more present, grounded, and meaningful life is possible—and who is ready to begin.</p><p>You may be experiencing stress, anxiety, or exhaustion and seeking real tools to help. You may be longing for greater clarity or connection. You may be curious about meditation but unsure where to start. Or you may have practiced for years and want to return to the foundations with fresh eyes.</p><p>No experience is necessary. Come as you are.</p><h3><strong>What's Included</strong></h3><ul><li>‍<strong>Four Weekly Sessions</strong> 90 minutes each, live on Zoom—a supportive space to learn, practice, and ask questions.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>Home Practice Support</strong> Guided meditations, mindful living practices, and reflection prompts to weave what you're learning into daily life.<strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>A Foundation for Continued Practice</strong> This course is complete in itself. It also serves as the gateway to deeper study, retreats, and ongoing community at Rooted in Mindfulness.</li></ul>","<h3>Go Deeper</h3><p>While not required, we encourage participants to attend a <strong>Day of Mindfulness Retreat</strong> following this course (Saturday, March 21). A day of extended practice is a beautiful way to integrate and deepen what you've learned—offering spaciousness, stillness, and the support of practicing together in community.

What is before our nose is what we see last.”,William Barrett,"<h3><strong>A personal note from the Facilitor (Jesse Foy):</strong></h3><p><em>Of all the practices I practice and share, Naikan holds a special place in my heart. I practice it regularly alongside loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity—but Naikan has a unique power to bring life-changing understanding and healing to how we see ourselves and everyone we're in relationship with. It's illuminating in ways that are hard to describe until you experience it: suddenly you notice what's always been there, and that noticing changes everything.</em> </p><p><em>I'm offering this workshop because I genuinely want you to have this practice in your life—not just to learn about it, but to walk away with a skill you can use immediately and return to again and again.</em></p><h3><strong>What is Naikan?</strong></h3><p>Naikan is a Japanese method of structured self-reflection—literally ""inside looking""—that helps you see your life and relationships more completely. Instead of analyzing yourself or circling the same old stories, Naikan invites you to examine specific relationships through three deceptively simple questions:</p><ol><li>What have I received from this person?</li><li>What have I given to this person?</li><li>What troubles or difficulties have I caused this person?</li></ol><h3><strong>How this 3-hour workshop works:</strong></h3><p>We'll explore the meaning and purpose of Naikan—why these questions matter and what they reveal. Then you'll practice the methods with deep intention, establishing the foundation so you can continue on your own. We won't move through all the years and people of your life (that's the work of longer retreats and an opportunity for you to do as a personal practice), but you'll experience the rhythm: quiet reflection followed by brief, supportive check-ins to help you and fellow participants understand and integrate the practice and holding space for what emerges without judgment.</p><h3><strong>What often shifts:</strong></h3><p>When you consistently ask these questions, something softens. You begin to see a fuller picture: the care you didn't register, the impact you didn't notice, the ways you've both been held and caused difficulty. This wider view often brings a quieter kind of gratitude, clearer responsibility, and more tenderness—toward yourself and others.</p><p>It's not about forcing positivity or getting rid of hard feelings. It's about seeing what else is true with greater understanding and care.</p><h3><strong>What you'll take home:</strong></h3><p>You'll leave with a practice you can use right away—as daily reflection, occasional life review, or a way to work with specific relationships when they feel stuck. Optional community support is available as you continue.</p>",<p>No prior meditation experience needed. Just willingness to spend time with your memories and see what you haven't been seeing.</p>,"Saturday, February 7",11:00 am - 2:00 pm,Saturday | February 7 | 11:00 am - 2:00 pm,Rooted In Mindfulness | In Person Only,,Suggested Program Dana (Donation) - $125,"<p>To participate in this and other RIM community programs, please <a href=""https://www.rootedinmindfulness.org/community-membership"" target=""_blank"">Create a (free) Member Account.</a> If you already have an account, sign in and register.</p><p>‍</p>",<p>Reserve your spot today. &nbsp;Please register with the form below.</p><p>‍</p>,true,false,jesse-foy,,,true,false,saturday,6.5,,Saturday,5nemX83h7gus,11:00 AM,,

Sometimes, an inquiry may need more time and attention than a group setting can provide. Private meetings can be immensely supportive for anyone who is seriously committed to their practice and learning.</p><h3>Who can participate?</h3><p>Private meetings are open to all active RIM members who have already been introduced to mindfulness and meditation. We ask that you are sincere and committed to your learning and practice and prepared to engage in the inner work required for self-awareness and cultivation.</p><h3>What to Expect:</h3><p>Private meetings are held in a supportive and contemplative framework. Please know that these meetings are not therapy sessions. Nevertheless, they do provide you with an opportunity to share honestly, sincerely, and intimately about your inner and outer life experiences as they relate to your meditation and mindful living practice. </p><p>This sincere and open sharing allows the teacher to suggest relevant meditation practices, home contemplations, and traditional dharma and modern mindfulness-based teachings. </p><h3>Preparing for Your Private Meeting</h3><p>Please be mindful of your intentions for scheduling a private meeting with the teacher. These sessions are not casual meetings. Instead, they provide meaningful support for your personal and spiritual development. <br></p><p>Please download and fill out a <strong>Private Meeting Worksheet</strong> before your meeting to ensure a meaningful and supportive session.</p><h3>Meeting Duration and Frequency</h3><p>Each session is typically scheduled for a half-hour or an hour at a time.
