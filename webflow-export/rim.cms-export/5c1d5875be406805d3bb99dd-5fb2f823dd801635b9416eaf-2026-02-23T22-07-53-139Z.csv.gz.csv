On one occasion, the Buddha addressed a gathering of monks, ""Friends,"" he began. ""Venerable, Sir,"" they replied. And the Buddha said,"" …</blockquote><p>Here, the Buddha introduced the Four-Foundations to those interested in establishing mindfulness in their everyday life. In the setting where and when this talk was given, the students were monks. That said, throughout the rest of the sutta, we use the word ""friends"" to refer to all fellow travelers walking this path. In that light, we, too, can realize the life-changing benefits that arise from these profound teachings and practices. </p><blockquote>""Friends, this is a direct path that leads to the purification of hearts and minds, for the overcoming of unhealthy stress, depression, and anxiety, for the transformation of suffering and discontentment, for attaining the noble path, for the realization of health, well-being, freedom, and awakening; specifically, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.""</blockquote><p>What is meant by the ""Direct Path""? The Buddha explains that the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is a path that leads to greater health, well-being, freedom, and awakening. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness helps us better understand ourselves and our life. With this understanding, we can purify our hearts and minds by transforming unhealthy emotions, thoughts, and behaviors while cultivating healthy ones. </p><p>The Four Foundations is part of a greater set of teachings and practices called the Eightfold-Path. The Eightfold-Path is at the heart of Buddhism and is a holistic model that supports a way of living that leads to self-understanding, self-development, and liberation. The Four Foundations are one of the eight Path Factors within the Eight-Fold Path. Within this context, the Four Foundations are called ""Right Mindfulness.</p><p>The mindfulness that arises as we cultivate the Four Foundations allows us to realize when unhealthy forms of suffering and discontent are present. It also helps us understand how they came to be and how they can be removed. Also, Mindfulness helps us fully appreciate when well-being and happiness are present, the supporting conditions, and how to sustain them. </p><p>When united with the Eightfold-Path, mindfulness leads to awakening and helps us live with Great Wisdom and Compassion. We become free to respond to life's moments in ways that benefit ourselves and those we touch throughout our lives. </p><p>As we walk this path, we will see how these teachings and practices support a happier and more fulfilling life. Please, keep in mind that to reach this path's destination, we must walk it and apply it to our life. The teachings are a map, and our life experience is the actual journey. </p><p>Notably, the Direct Path repeats at the end of the Satipatthana. This time, we can think of it as a culmination. First, by placing the Direct Path at the beginning, the Buddha teaches that the Direct Path is possible. Second, we can imagine that it may be relevant to us by placing it at the end. We, too, can realize the goal for ourselves through direct lived experience. After all, ""Buddha"" means one who is awake. At this point, we become more awake ourselves and are empowered to realize our own innate Buddha Nature.</p>",false, The four Satipatthanas represent a path that leads straight and directly all the way to the final goal.,- Gethin,jesse-foy,

Because it is related the concepts explored in this class, I thought that I would helpful to share it with this group. </em></p><h4>Talk Transcript (<em>word-for-word from the recording</em>):</h4><p>In this practice, we're trying to really know ourselves. We're trying to discover how it is that you, we as individuals are put together in any given moment, how we're relating to this experience of our life. And. And what we're doing. And we're really cultivating through this repetitive seeing and understanding of who we are. We're doing that enough to be able to shape our heart and mind and our life in ways that are helpful, that are healthy.</p><p>It's a nice thing to contemplate this question of free will. We talk about karma at rim and sometimes when we talk about karma, it can feel like we're just at the whim of things of our past events or how we relate to things. And it can feel like we don't have a lot of choice. But that's opposite of what this tradition is trying to reveal to us. So there are three views. In this tradition that if we hold on to or think about too much, that they can limit our ability to be present and the kind of fulfill what this practice is asking us to fulfill.</p><p>And these three things are the belief, the view that everything is predetermined. And this means that we're just these beings who are here on this earth and whether it's through a divine intervention or some other reason, just this cascade of cause and effect that we don't have free will.</p><p>And whatever we think, whatever we do whatever's happening in the world has somehow been predetermined by either just the natural unfolding of things, or by by some kind of outside force in this tradition, because we're trying to cultivate a certain amount of self knowledge and self empowerment. This tradition says maybe not hold on to that view so rigidly. Because if we think that everything's predetermined, why are we practicing anyway? You know what's the point of all of this? So one thing that a lot of these things these three things that I'll talk about sometimes they they take that drive away. If we feel like something's predetermined, it takes that, that drive away to actually have responsibility for ourself. </p><p>Another common idea of karma is that you get what you deserve. You did this and the repercussions of that will happen. If you do good, then good will happen if you do bad than bad will happen. And if we feel like we're caught in that predetermination with karmic choice then that's a misunderstanding of karma. And we think about it too much and we let it shape our views and our approach. It limits our capacity to be more awake. </p><p>The next one, the third one is. Everything is free will. There's no real set order of things necessarily. And we can do unwholesome things here and get rich. Maybe mean good, it's whatever, there's no karma there. There's no, repercussions there. And we see that we made the choice and, or whatever, and that there's this, that everything is determined by whatever we're thinking in this moment. And that's considered an unhealthy on beneficial view. If we hold too tightly onto that.</p><p>When we look at those three different categories, it's easy to get a little frustrated or confused with this practice. Because, if it's not all pre determined. If there isn't, this kind of reward and punishment system that we're part of. And if it's not just free, will. What's the alternative?</p><p>What else has there, what is there? And this speaks to the scientific approach of this practice and also this invitation to practice and this, it's sometimes coined as the middle way, the middle path. That there that there's something in between all extremes. And, usually the things that are in between all of these extremes start to include the holistic nature of things. So if we look with a kind of inquisitive, honest mind and attitude, we start to see more possibilities. </p><p>So karma as it is understood in this tradition. And when I say this tradition, early Buddhist tradition, the essence of the Buddha Dharma. Karma is intention. Karma is when we think in an intentional way and our words, and our actions, and our thoughts are acted upon according to that and an intention they pull and they shape. What we think of next, what we feel, what we do, how we approach things. And this karma is sometimes called action, and the fruit of our action. And an example is if we really practice kindness we really practice creating safety in our own heart and mind. And, know, we make it an, a priority. It's an intentional priority that we act on. The more we act on that, the more kind we're going to be. The more we practice greed or self selfishness. And the more we. We approach the world like that. That's what we shape and incline our mind to be. So karma represents intentional decision.</p><p>It means what we do shapes and inclines our heart and mind. Karma is part. And this is where we can find an answer to those three confusing views. Karma is part of a greater order karma as part of something called interdependent co arising, which means cause and effect, but cause and effect in that. All causes and all effects are related to a greater whole. If we look out into the world, we can see that all of it has been born out of infinite amount of interrelated causes and conditions. </p><p>And so we can look at these two things, karma in codependent origination, on the surface, we can say we know spring will come after winter. It's predetermined. We know that and just by studying the laws of how things are interrelated together, it can feel like there's a certain amount of kind of predetermination happening. And there is but when we apply the rule, the principle of karma with the principle of interdependent co-arising we can see. In this moment, our choice, our volition, what we want to do, what we want to think, how we want to act, how we respond. We can see that to a large degree, how we feel and think in any given moment has been conditioned by prior moments. </p><p>Compliments are a funny thing. We can receive a compliment and we can receive it with happiness, or we can receive it with doubt and or some multiple other things. And so someone gives us a compliment. We might feel happy and at peace, or we might feel insecure. How was that determined? It was determined by our past relationship to compliments, the kind of compliments we received, how we were when we received them. How we chose intentionally to respond is based off of all of that kind of conditioning and past choice. </p><p>There's a really interesting aspect. And that is, of course everything happened due to causes and conditions. And we might have even responded in that moment out of that kind of habitual conditioning, but there's also something else magic that happens if we show up with presence, stability, calm, clarity. We can see how things were shaped. We can see how we became in this moment. And then suddenly we have this opportunity to choose otherwise. We can see, and then we can say, huh? I took that compliment like really hard. They were just complimenting, but I went into this downward spiral about it, and isn't that interesting.</p><p>So in that moment, based off of kind of our prior understanding of cause and effect, and in all of this stuff, we suddenly have this ability to choose. Where did it come from? Sure. Some conditioning. Some karmic inclination. But regardless what we choose in this moment has the ability to shape not only new possibilities, but it has the opportunity to shape all this interdependent core arising and this karmic conditioning.</p><p>So we can say maybe we've been walking around angry or frustrated or in our own head and seeing things and from our likes and dislikes in a strong way, in a particular way. And we've just been going about our day like that our days. And at one point we, we wake up, we see, huh? This hurts, this isn't helpful to to those I care about or myself and suddenly we have this opportunity to choose, and our choices is relative to the conditions that we're in.</p><p>So we might say I'm going to, instead of being preoccupied with all of this stuff, I'm going to choose something else I'm going to choose. Something that relates to this practice , and try to respond in a way that's different. And we just, in that response, along with the volitional effort, we just changed the causes of conditions. We just changed our heart and mind. We just changed that inclination. </p><p>And so we just interject it our free choice by rising above our chronic karmic conditioning and seeing how we relate to the greater whole inside or outside. And we're able to change things inside and out in our life. So this points to another aspect called Sila. And Sila that means wholesome response or integrity or morality or ethics.</p><p>If intention or volition karma, is interrelated with choice and inaction. If we see that we apply our right intention traditionally to to nourish what is healthy into, let go of things that are unhealthy. And then this falls into the realm of kind of morality. Of ethics of wholesomeness versus unwholesome newness of cultivating wellbeing instead of cultivating ill being. </p><p>And so embedded in this choice, in this tradition, in our karmic inclination and our interdependent co rising the cause and effect of the world. When we're awake. When we have choice, this practice asks us to remember what is wholesome? What is healthy? What is beneficial? And to understand, and to see what is wholesome and beneficial. It requires us to see how we've been responding to see how that response is. Is connected to our everyday life and to see where we have choice. And when we have choice, if we can choose to shape things in a way that is wholesome is beneficial. </p><p>In this tradition, we talk about great wisdom in great compassion. A great wisdom is the wisdom that understands that we have this opportunity of choice. But it also understands the limitations of that choice based off of the conditions that are there outside and inside.</p><p>The compassion part understands that when we do act, it should be acting in a way that is healthy. But in order to see, what is healthy choice, healthy response, healthy freedom. This is where the hard work comes in. And the hard work is training ourselves to understand, to discover ourselves to create the environment through meditation and through mindful living. To be able to counter that, that false belief that this is predetermined. How I am. Or this is, Oh, I shouldn't have done that. I don't deserve to be happy or whatever, all of this stuff, or, this is divine will or whatever. Instead we want to. Interject a kind of self knowledge, a self discovery to understand who we are in relationship to what we're doing. And through meditation practice and mindful living, so much of our practice is becoming aware of the the way that we've been shaped. </p><p>Then after self discovery, there's the self cultivation. So we discover, this is how I am in this moment. Oh, it's hard. I, Oh, I see my parents' parenting skill show up here, in this situation. Boy, does that show up? Yeah, I understand this is, yeah, this is how things have been conditioned. But wait, I have this intention to be better than this- to be more healthy than this. And then that based off of that care and that understanding, then we do the work of cultivation. How I can see how when a happens triggers my B reactivity, which triggers the C. I was going to say shit show, but it triggers that. And so the cultivation is I need to work on this. I need to see when I'm triggered like this. I need to see that this kind of clinging, and this reactivity based off of these kinds of conditions, and try to do the best I can to cultivate otherwise.</p><p>And this leads to freedom. To wellbeing. This position in this freedom goes full circle back. I have the ability to see my karmic conditioning. I can have this ability to see the series of causes and effects, and I have the freedom to choose what is healthy in this moment more. Readily. And that's what the practice brings to us.</p>",true,,,jesse-foy,

But what exactly does it mean?</p><p id="""">At its core, Bodhicitta is the heartfelt wish to awaken fully to reality - not just for our own sake, but for the benefit of all beings. It's a profound intention that bridges our current experience with our highest potential, connecting our immediate actions to our ultimate spiritual goals.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Bodhicitta operates on two levels:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">‍<strong id="""">Relative Bodhicitta:</strong> This is the practical application of the aspiration in our daily lives.

It's a practice we can engage with throughout our day. Here are some practical ways to nurture your Bodhicitta:<strong id="""">‍</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id="""">‍<strong id="""">Morning Intention Setting:</strong> Start each day by reconnecting with your aspiration.

It weaves through all aspects of our practice, influencing how we engage with each element of the Handful of Leaves model:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">It shapes our approach to ethics, mental discipline, and wisdom on the Eightfold Path.</li><li id="""">It motivates our efforts to cultivate wholesome mind-states and transform unwholesome ones.</li><li id="""">It informs what we pay attention to in our contemplative practice and how we interpret our experiences.</li></ul><p id="""">As you continue to explore other practices and concepts, keep returning to this fundamental aspiration. Let it be the thread that weaves all aspects of your practice into a coherent, meaningful whole.</p><h3 id="""">A Contemplative Exercise: Deepening Your Aspiration</h3><p id="""">To deepen your connection with the Aspiration for Awakening, try this contemplation:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Find a quiet place to sit comfortably. Allow your body to settle and your breath to find its natural rhythm.</li><li id="""">Bring to mind your deepest wish for yourself – not for external achievements or possessions, but for inner qualities like peace, clarity, or freedom.</li><li id="""">Imagine this wish as a small, glowing ember at the center of your being. With each breath, visualize this ember growing brighter and warmer.</li><li id="""">As the ember grows into a flame, imagine its warmth and light extending beyond yourself to include all beings everywhere. Visualize the awakening of wisdom and compassion spreading throughout the world, bringing benefit to all.</li><li id="""">Let yourself feel the power and beauty of this aspiration.</li><li id="""">As you conclude, set an intention to carry this feeling with you throughout your day, letting it inform your choices and actions.</li></ol><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection:</em></strong><em id=""""> After trying this exercise, how does your understanding of the Aspiration for Awakening shift? How might it influence your approach to daily challenges?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">Tending the Fire of Bodhicitta</h3><p id="""">As we cultivate the Aspiration for Awakening, it's important to approach it with both dedication and gentleness. This is a lifelong journey, not a destination we reach overnight. We nurture Bodhicitta not out of a sense of lack or self-criticism, but out of love for ourselves and all beings, and out of recognition of our inherent potential for wisdom and compassion.</p><p id="""">Remember, every moment holds the potential for awakening. Each time you reconnect with your aspiration, you're fanning that inner spark, helping it grow into a flame that can illuminate your path and warm the world around you.</p><p id="""">As you move forward, may your Aspiration for Awakening grow ever stronger, illuminating your way towards greater wisdom, compassion, and freedom, for the benefit of all beings. And may you always remember that though at times there may seem to be only ashes, that precious ember is always there, waiting to be gently and lovingly tended into a brilliant, warming flame.</p>",false,"""The energy of bodhicitta is born from our deep understanding of the interdependence of all life and the wish to contribute to the well-being of others.""",— Thich Nhat Hanh,jesse-foy,

The impact creates ripples that spread outward, touching every part of the water's surface. In much the same way, our actions - no matter how small they might seem - create ripples that extend far beyond our immediate surroundings, influencing others and the world around us in ways we might not always perceive.</p><p id="""">Great Action, or Ati-Kamma in Pali, is the embodiment of this understanding. It's the conscious, skillful engagement with the world that arises from the union of Great Wisdom and Great Compassion. It's not just about doing good deeds, but about acting with a deep awareness of the interconnected nature of all things and the far-reaching consequences of our choices.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection:</em></strong><em id=""""> Think of a time when a small action of yours had unexpectedly far-reaching effects. How did this experience shape your understanding of the impact of your actions?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">Understanding Great Action</h3><p id="""">Great Action, or Ati-Kamma in Pali, represents the manifestation of our deepest insights and most heartfelt care in our thoughts, speech, and actions. It's the practical expression of the wisdom and compassion we've been cultivating, brought to life in our everyday interactions with the world.</p><p id="""">Great Action is about engaging with the world consciously and skillfully, always mindful of the interconnected nature of all things and the consequences of our choices. It recognizes that every action we take, no matter how small, has the potential to create significant change.</p><p id="""">Great Action is characterized by four key aspects, which align closely with the traditional Buddhist concept of Right Effort, a crucial element of the Noble Eightfold Path:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Preventing Unwholesome States:</strong> This involves making a conscious effort to prevent negative or harmful mind-states and behaviors from arising. It's about cultivating awareness and creating conditions that support positive mental states. For example, this might mean avoiding situations or influences that we know tend to bring out the worst in us.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Abandoning Harmful Patterns:</strong> When we notice that unwholesome states have already arisen, Great Action calls us to make an effort to let them go. This requires recognizing harmful thoughts or behaviors and consciously choosing to release them. It might involve practices like mindfulness and cognitive reframing to shift our mental state.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Cultivating Wholesome Qualities:</strong> This aspect focuses on actively developing positive states that haven't yet arisen. It's about nurturing qualities like compassion, mindfulness, generosity, and wisdom. This could involve engaging in formal practices like loving-kindness meditation, or simply making a conscious effort to cultivate these qualities in our daily interactions.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Maintaining Beneficial Actions:</strong> Once we've developed positive states and behaviors, Great Action involves making an effort to maintain and strengthen them. This is about reinforcing and deepening our positive qualities, turning them from occasional occurrences into stable traits. It might involve regular practice, reflection, or deliberately putting ourselves in situations where we can exercise these qualities.</li></ol><p id="""">These four aspects work together to create a dynamic practice of Great Action. They encourage us to be proactive in nurturing what is beneficial, transforming what is harmful, and protecting against negative influences.</p><p id="""">In this way, Great Action serves to maintain balance and harmony in our lives and in the world around us. It's a responsive force, adapting skillfully to the ever-changing conditions of life, always working towards the benefit of all beings.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection:</em></strong><em id=""""> Consider a challenging situation in your life right now. How might you apply these four aspects of Great Action to address it? What would preventing, abandoning, cultivating, and maintaining look like in this context?</em></blockquote><p id="""">By engaging in Great Action, we become active participants in our own growth and in the well-being of the world around us. We're not passive observers, but conscious creators of positive change, moment by moment, thought by thought, action by action.</p><h3 id="""">How Great Action Shapes Our Practice</h3><p id="""">Let's explore some ways Great Action fulfills the five functions of Guiding Aspirations:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Setting the Tone for Our Practice:</strong> <br>Great Action reminds us that our practice extends beyond formal meditation or study. It infuses every moment with the potential for awakened activity, encouraging us to bring mindfulness, wisdom, and compassion into all aspects of our lives.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Maintaining a Long-Term Perspective:</strong> <br>The aspiration for Great Action connects our immediate choices to their long-term consequences, both for ourselves and others. It helps us see how each action, no matter how small, contributes to the unfolding of our path and impacts the world around us.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Inspiring Growth and Transformation:</strong> <br>Great Action continually challenges us to align our behavior with our highest understanding and deepest care. It inspires us to stretch beyond our habitual patterns and to embody our aspirations more fully in each moment.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Providing an Ethical Framework:</strong> <br>Great Action offers a dynamic framework for ethical living. It encourages us to consider the intentions behind our actions, their immediate effects, and their long-term consequences, guiding us towards choices that benefit ourselves and others.<strong id=""""><br>Cultivating Meaning and Purpose:</strong> <br>The cultivation of Great Action imbues our daily lives with profound meaning. It reminds us that every moment is an opportunity to express our wisdom and compassion, giving even the most mundane activities a sense of purpose and significance.</li></ol><h3 id="""">The Interplay of Wisdom, Compassion, and Action</h3><p id="""">Great Action emerges as the natural culmination of Great Wisdom and Great Compassion, bringing our understanding and care into tangible manifestation:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Great Wisdom</strong>, as we've explored, provides the clear seeing that informs our actions, helping us understand the true nature of situations and the potential consequences of our choices.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Great Compassion</strong>, as we've seen, provides the heart motivation for our actions, ensuring that our efforts are directed towards the benefit of all beings.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Great Action</strong> is where wisdom and compassion come to life, allowing us to embody our understanding and care in ways that can transform ourselves and the world around us.</li></ul><p id="""">In this triad, action serves as the bridge between our inner realizations and their outer expression. It's through our actions that wisdom and compassion become more than abstract ideals, manifesting as real change in our lives and in the world.</p><p id="""">As we engage in Great Action, we also deepen our wisdom through direct experience and cultivate greater compassion through our encounters with others. Thus, the cycle continues, each aspect continually informing and enhancing the others in our ongoing practice.</p><h3 id="""">Nurturing Great Action in Daily Life</h3><p id="""">While Great Action may sound grand, it's cultivated through our everyday choices and behaviors. Here are some ways to bring Great Action into your daily life:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Mindful Speech:</strong> Pay attention to your words, ensuring they're truthful, kind, and beneficial.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Conscious Consumption:</strong> Make choices about what you consume (food, media, products) with awareness of their broader impacts.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Skillful Responses:</strong> When faced with challenges, pause to consider how you can respond in a way that embodies wisdom and compassion.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Environmental Stewardship:</strong> Take actions to reduce your environmental impact, protect natural resources, and promote the health our precious planet.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Service to Others:</strong> Look for opportunities to help others, even in small ways.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Personal Growth:</strong> Continuously work on developing positive habits and transforming negative ones.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Ethical Decision-Making:</strong> In all your choices, consider the effects on yourself, others, and the broader world.</li></ol><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Try This:</em></strong><em id=""""> Choose one area of your life where you'd like to embody Great Action more fully. For the next week, make a conscious effort to apply the principles we've discussed to this area. At the end of each day, reflect on the effects of your efforts.</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">Great Action in the Context of Dharma Practice</h3><p id="""">Great Action is intimately connected with many aspects of the Buddhist path:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">It's the practical application of the Four Noble Truths, especially the Fourth Truth which outlines the path to the cessation of suffering.</li><li id="""">It embodies the Noble Eightfold Path, particularly Right Action, Right Speech, and Right Livelihood.</li><li id="""">It's a key aspect of karma, understanding that our actions have consequences that shape our experience and the world around us.</li><li id="""">It's an expression of the Bodhisattva ideal, working tirelessly for the benefit of all beings.</li></ul><p id="""">As we deepen our understanding of Great Action, we come to see that every moment is an opportunity for practice, every interaction a chance to manifest our highest aspirations.</p><h3 id="""">A Contemplative Exercise: The Ripple Effect Meditation</h3><p id="""">To deepen your connection with Great Action, try this contemplative exercise:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Find a comfortable seated position. Allow your body to settle and your breath to find its natural rhythm.</li><li id="""">Bring to mind a small, positive action you've taken recently. It could be as simple as a kind word or a moment of patience.</li><li id="""">Visualize this action as a pebble dropping into a still pond. See the ripples spreading outward.</li><li id="""">Imagine how this action might have affected the person directly involved. How might it have influenced their mood, their subsequent actions?</li><li id="""">Now, imagine these effects spreading further. How might this person's changed state have affected others they interacted with?</li><li id="""">Continue to expand your vision, seeing the ripples of your action spreading out into the world in ever-widening circles.</li><li id="""">Reflect on how this understanding might influence your future choices and actions.</li></ol><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection: </em></strong><em id="""">After this exercise, how has your perception of the impact of your actions changed? How might this influence your approach to daily life?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">Conclusion: Every Action Matters</h3><p id="""">As we cultivate Great Action, we come to realize that every thought, word, and deed has the potential to create significant change. We're not separate from the world, but intricately connected to it. Our actions are like threads in a vast web, each one contributing to the overall pattern.</p><p id="""">Remember, the cultivation of Great Action is a gradual process. It begins with small, mindful choices, deepens through practice and reflection, and eventually becomes a spontaneous expression of our wisdom and compassion.</p><p id="""">As you move forward in your exploration of the Handful of Leaves model, let Great Action be your way of embodying the insights and aspirations you're cultivating. May your actions bring benefit to yourself and all beings, contributing to the healing and awakening of our world.</p>",false,"""Great action is the bridge between our inner and outer worlds.

But along with this light comes a gentle, pervasive warmth that nurtures life, promotes growth, and brings comfort - this is compassion.</p><p id="""">Great Compassion, or Ati-Karuṇā in Pali, is like this all-encompassing warmth. It's a fundamental force that, when cultivated, has the power to heal, transform, and liberate not just ourselves, but all beings.</p><p id="""">This compassion isn't a passive feeling of pity or sympathy. Rather, it's an active, courageous force that moves us to respond skillfully to suffering wherever we encounter it. Like a caring guardian who is attuned to the needs of those in their care, Great Compassion is ever-ready to act in ways that restore well-being when health or integrity is compromised.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection:</em></strong><em id=""""> Take a moment to recall a time when you felt deeply cared for or when you offered care to another. What qualities were present in that experience? How did it feel in your body and mind?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">Understanding Great Compassion</h3><p id="""">Great Compassion, or Ati-Karuṇā, is more than just a feeling of care or concern. It's a profound wish for all beings to be free from suffering, coupled with the willingness to act towards that end. This compassion:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Recognizes the universality of suffering and our shared wish for happiness</li><li id="""">Responds courageously and skillfully to alleviate suffering</li><li id="""">Extends to all beings without exception, including those we might consider difficult or undeserving</li><li id="""">Is grounded in wisdom, understanding the true nature of suffering and its causes</li></ul><p id="""">It's crucial to understand that Great Compassion isn't separate from Great Wisdom (Ati-Paññā) that we explored in the previous section. They are like two wings of a bird, both necessary for flight. True compassion arises from our deepening understanding of the nature of reality, and in turn, compassion opens our hearts, allowing wisdom to penetrate more deeply.</p><h3 id="""">The Qualities of Great Compassion</h3><p id="""">Great Compassion is characterized by several key qualities; here are a few:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Universality:</strong> It extends to all beings without exception.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Wisdom:</strong> It's informed by understanding the true nature of suffering and its causes.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Equanimity:</strong> Great Compassion remains steady even in the face of suffering in our lives and the world.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Courage:</strong> It doesn't shy away from suffering but moves towards it with the intention to help.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Skillful Responsiveness:</strong> Like a caring guardian attuned to the needs of those in their care, it responds appropriately to each situation.</li></ol><h3 id="""">How Great Compassion Shapes Our Practice</h3><p id="""">Let's explore how Great Compassion fulfills the five functions of Guiding Aspirations:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Setting the Tone for Our Practice:</strong> <br>Great Compassion infuses our entire practice with a spirit of care and concern for all beings.

This dynamic interplay continues to unfold as we progress on the path, each aspect enhancing and being enhanced by the others.</p><h3 id="""">Compassion in the Broader Context of Dharma</h3><p id="""">Great Compassion is intimately linked with many aspects of the Buddhist path. For instance, it connects directly to the Four Noble Truths, particularly the Fourth Noble Truth which outlines the path to the cessation of suffering. Our compassionate wish for all beings to be free from suffering naturally leads us to walk this path ourselves and to support others in doing so.</p><p id="""">Moreover, compassion is both a result of and a support for our entire dharma practice:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">It motivates us to engage deeply with the teachings and practices.</li><li id="""">It helps us navigate the challenges we encounter on the path.</li><li id="""">It ensures that our growing wisdom and insights benefit not just ourselves, but all beings.</li><li id="""">It fuels our commitment to ethical conduct and mindful living.</li></ul><p id="""">As we deepen in compassion, we come to see that our own liberation and the liberation of all beings are inseparable.</p><h3 id="""">A Contemplative Exercise: Tonglen Practice</h3><p id="""">To connect with and cultivate Great Compassion, let's engage in a Tonglen practice. Tonglen, a Tibetan Buddhist practice, involves breathing in suffering and breathing out relief.

Its roots reach deep into the earth, intertwining with countless other organisms. Its branches stretch towards the sky, swaying with the winds of countless seasons. This tree has witnessed the cyclical nature of life—seeds sprouting, plants growing, leaves falling, and matter returning to the soil.</p><p id="""">If this tree could share its wisdom, it wouldn't speak of fixed truths or unchanging reality. Instead, it would reveal a world of constant flux, of intricate interconnections, of arising and passing away. It would show us that nothing exists in isolation, that everything is part of a vast, ever-changing web of cause and effect.</p><p id="""">This tree's perspective isn't just a poetic metaphor. In fact, it reflects the potential for Great Wisdom that exists within each of us. As we cultivate this wisdom, we too can see beyond our limited, habitual views to perceive the true nature of reality.</p><p id="""">Great Wisdom, or Ati-Paññā in Pali, is not about accumulating knowledge or intellectual understanding. It represents a profound, experiential insight into the fundamental nature of existence.&nbsp;</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection:</em></strong><em id=""""> Take a moment to consider: How might your life change if you could see every situation from this broader, wiser perspective? How might it affect your reactions, your decisions, your relationships?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">Understanding Great Wisdom</h3><p id="""">Great Wisdom in Buddhism is characterized by several key insights:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Impermanence (Anicca):</strong> Just as our tree witnesses the constant cycle of growth and decay, Great Wisdom perceives the ever-changing nature of all phenomena. It sees that nothing lasts forever, that every experience, thought, and feeling arises and passes away.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Unsatisfactoriness (Dukkha):</strong> Wisdom recognizes that clinging to impermanent phenomena inevitably leads to dissatisfaction. Like trying to grasp at falling leaves, attachment to what is inherently transient causes suffering.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Non-self (Anatta):</strong> Great Wisdom sees through the illusion of a fixed, separate self. Just as our tree is not separate from the ecosystem it's part of, we too are not isolated entities but part of an interconnected whole.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Dependent Origination (Paticca-samuppāda):</strong> This insight reveals how all phenomena arise in dependence upon conditions. Like how the tree depends on soil, water, and sunlight, every aspect of our experience is conditioned by countless factors.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Emptiness (Suññatā):</strong> Great Wisdom understands that all phenomena lack inherent existence. Like how the tree is empty of an unchanging ""tree essence,"" all things are empty of an intrinsic, independent nature.</li></ol><p id="""">These insights are not abstract philosophical concepts, but direct realizations that radically transform our experience of life. As we cultivate Great Wisdom, we begin to see reality with increasing clarity, free from the distortions of our habitual patterns and conditioning.</p><h3 id="""">How Great Wisdom Shapes Our Practice</h3><p id="""">Great Wisdom profoundly influences every aspect of our practice and daily life. Let's explore how it fulfills the five functions of Guiding Aspirations:<br></p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Setting the Tone for Our Practice:</strong> Great Wisdom encourages us to approach our practice with curiosity and openness. It reminds us to look beyond surface appearances and to investigate the true nature of our experiences. This clear-seeing attitude infuses our meditation, our daily activities, and our interactions with others.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Maintaining a Long-Term Perspective:</strong> As we cultivate Great Wisdom, we begin to see the long-term consequences of our actions and choices. We understand that every moment of practice, every act of kindness, contributes to our gradual awakening. This perspective helps us persevere through challenges, knowing that our efforts are part of a larger journey.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li></ol><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Inspiring Growth and Transformation:</strong> Great Wisdom continually challenges our habitual patterns and fixed views. As we see more clearly the impermanent and interconnected nature of reality, we're inspired to let go of what no longer serves us. This ongoing process of insight and release leads to profound personal transformation.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li></ol><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Providing an Ethical Framework:</strong> With Great Wisdom, we develop the discernment to recognize wholesome and unwholesome actions. We see more clearly the effects of our choices on ourselves and others. This understanding naturally guides us towards ethical behavior, not out of blind adherence to rules, but from a deep comprehension of cause and effect.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li></ol><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Cultivating Meaning and Purpose:</strong> As we develop Great Wisdom, we gain a clearer understanding of the nature of suffering and the path to its cessation. This insight gives our practice, and indeed our life, a profound sense of purpose. We're no longer merely reacting to circumstances, but consciously cultivating a path of awakening for the benefit of all beings.</li></ol><h3 id="""">Nurturing Great Wisdom in Daily Life</h3><p id="""">While Great Wisdom may seem lofty or abstract, there are many ways we can cultivate it in our daily lives:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Mindful Observation:</strong> Practice observing your experiences, thoughts, and emotions without getting caught up in them. Notice their changing nature, like watching leaves flutter on a tree.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Questioning Assumptions:</strong> Regularly challenge your habitual ways of seeing things. Ask yourself, ""Is this really true? Is there another way to look at this?""<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Studying the Dharma:</strong> Engage with Buddhist teachings, reflecting on how they relate to your own experience. Let the wisdom of the tradition inform your understanding.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Meditation Practice:</strong> Engage in both concentration and insight meditation to develop clarity and penetrating wisdom.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Ethical Living:</strong> Practice living ethically, observing how this creates the conditions for greater clarity of mind.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Contemplating Impermanence:</strong> Regularly reflect on the changing nature of all things in your life, from your body to your possessions to your relationships.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Investigating Interconnection:</strong> Look for the ways in which all things are connected and interdependent, like tracing the roots of our metaphorical tree.</li></ol><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Try This:</em></strong><em id=""""> Choose one of these practices to focus on for the next week. At the end of each day, reflect on what new insights or perspectives you've gained. How has this practice affected your way of seeing and understanding your experiences?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">The Interplay with Compassion and Action</h3><p id="""">As we cultivate Great Wisdom, it's essential to understand that it doesn't exist in isolation. It works in concert with Great Compassion (Ati-Karuṇā) and Great Action (Ati-Kamma), which we'll explore in upcoming sections.</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Wisdom forms the foundation of our practice, providing clear seeing and understanding of the true nature of reality.</li><li id="""">This wisdom naturally gives rise to compassion as we recognize the universal nature of suffering and our interconnectedness with all beings.</li><li id="""">Informed by wisdom, our actions become more skillful and aligned with the Dharma, leading to the benefit of ourselves and others.</li></ul><p id="""">While wisdom is fundamental, it finds its fullest expression when united with compassion and manifested through action. As we continue our exploration, we'll see how these three aspects interweave to form a powerful triad that guides and empowers our entire practice.</p><h3 id="""">A Contemplative Exercise: Accessing Great Wisdom</h3><p id="""">To connect with your innate capacity for Great Wisdom, try this contemplation:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Find a quiet place to sit comfortably. Allow your body to settle and your breath to find its natural rhythm.</li><li id="""">Bring to mind the image of the ancient tree we described earlier. See it standing strong through countless seasons, witnessing the ever-changing world around it.</li><li id="""">Now, imagine you are this tree. Feel your roots deep in the earth, your branches stretching to the sky.</li><li id="""">From this perspective, observe the world around you. Notice the constant change - the cycle of days and nights, the passing of seasons, the growth and decay of other plants and creatures.</li><li id="""">Reflect on how everything you observe is interconnected - the soil, the water, the air, the sunlight, all the living beings.</li><li id="""">Consider how you, as this tree, are both a distinct entity and inseparably part of this whole ecosystem.</li><li id="""">As you conclude, bring this broader perspective back to your human experience. How might you view your current challenges or joys differently from this wise, expansive viewpoint?</li></ol><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection:</em></strong><em id=""""> After this exercise, has your understanding of wisdom shifted? How might you bring this tree-like perspective into your daily life?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">The Journey to Great Wisdom</h3><p id="""">As we cultivate Great Wisdom, we're not acquiring something new, but rather uncovering a capacity that has always been within us. Like our ancient tree, we have the potential to see the world with profound clarity and understanding.</p><p id="""">Remember, the cultivation of Great Wisdom is a gradual process. It begins with learning and reflection, deepens through meditation and direct experience, and culminates in transformative insight. Each step on this path is valuable, each moment of clarity a precious gift.</p><p id="""">As you move forward in your exploration of the Handful of Leaves model, let Great Wisdom be your guide. May it help you see the true nature of reality, revealing the impermanence, interconnectedness, and ultimate freedom inherent in all things. And may this wisdom benefit not just yourself, but all beings everywhere, like a great tree offering shade and sustenance to all who come near.</p>",false,"""Great Wisdom is to see with an open mind and caring heart: seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary, the sacred in the mundane, and the infinite depths within everybody and everything.""",— Jesse Foy,jesse-foy,

What's the first thing you'd need? Before provisions, before a sturdy ship, you'd need a clear destination and a reliable compass. In the journey of spiritual practice and personal growth, Guiding Aspirations serve as both our destination and our compass.<br></p><p id="""">These aspirations are not mere wishful thinking or lofty ideals disconnected from our daily lives. They are powerful intentions that shape our thoughts, words, and actions, bridging the gap between our current experience and our highest potential. They provide the motivational fuel that sustains us through challenges and setbacks, reminding us of our deepest values and resolves.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection:</em></strong><em id=""""> Before we explore further, take a moment to consider: What guides your life right now? What deep wishes or intentions shape your daily choices and long-term goals?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">The Power of Intention</h3><p id="""">At the heart of Guiding Aspirations lies the power of intention. Intention is the energy that gives direction and purpose to our practice and our lives. Without clear intentions, we risk drifting aimlessly, our actions guided by habit, impulse, or external pressures rather than our deepest values and aspirations.</p><p id="""">To understand the importance of intention, ask yourself: When you lose sight of your intentions, who is guiding the ship of your life? Are you moving purposefully towards greater wisdom, compassion, and freedom, or are you simply reacting to the winds and currents of circumstance?</p><p id="""">By cultivating and regularly reconnecting with our Guiding Aspirations, we ensure that our intentions remain clear and strong, providing a steady course through both calm seas and storms.</p><h3 id="""">The Seven Guiding Aspirations</h3><p id="""">In the Handful of Leaves model, we focus on seven key Guiding Aspirations. Each of these will be explored in depth in the lessons that follow, but for now, let's briefly introduce them:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Aspiration for Awakening (Bodhicitta)</li><li id="""">Bodhisattva Vows (Bodhisattva Pranidhāna)</li><li id="""">Great Wisdom (Ati-Paññā)</li><li id="""">Great Compassion (Ati-Karuṇā)</li><li id="""">Great Action (Ati-Kamma)</li><li id="""">Well-being for Self and Others (Sukhāya Hitāya Atthāya)</li><li id="""">Liberation (Nibbāna)</li></ol><p id="""">These aspirations work together, supporting and enhancing each other, to guide us on our path. They address both our immediate concerns and our ultimate spiritual goals, providing a comprehensive framework for our practice.</p><h3 id="""">The Five Key Functions of Guiding Aspirations</h3><p id="""">As we explore each of these aspirations in the coming articles, we'll see how they fulfill five key functions in our practice:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Setting the Tone for Our Practice:</strong> Guiding Aspirations inform everything we do on the path, influencing how we engage with each aspect of our practice.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Maintaining a Long-Term Perspective:</strong> They help us connect our immediate efforts to our overarching intentions, providing motivation and context for our practice.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Inspiring Growth and Transformation:</strong> These aspirations challenge us to stretch beyond our current limitations, fostering continuous growth and transformation.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Providing an Ethical Framework:</strong> They offer guidance for making wise and compassionate choices in our daily lives.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Cultivating Meaning and Purpose:</strong> Guiding Aspirations imbue our journey with a sense of purpose, contributing to overall well-being and resilience.</li></ol><p id="""">Understanding these functions can help us appreciate the profound impact that clear, conscious aspirations can have on our practice and our lives.</p><h3 id="""">Cultivating Awareness of Your Aspirations</h3><p id="""">While we haven't yet delved into the specific Guiding Aspirations, we can begin to cultivate a greater awareness of the aspirations that are already present in our lives. Here's a simple exercise to start this process:</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Try This:</em></strong><em id=""""> Find a quiet moment to sit comfortably. Take a few deep breaths to center yourself. Then, ask yourself these questions:<br>‍<br>~&nbsp;What are my deepest wishes for myself? For others? For the world?<br>~ What qualities or states of being do I most value or admire?<br>~ If I could dedicate my life to one purpose, what would it be?<br><br>Don't worry about finding perfect answers. Simply notice what arises naturally. These reflections can give you a sense of the aspirations that are already guiding your life, even if you haven't explicitly named them before.</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">Looking Ahead: The Journey of Exploration</h3><p id="""">In the lessons that follow, we'll explore each of the seven Guiding Aspirations in depth.

It's not about perfection, but about continuous growth and transformation. Each small step we take in aligning our lives with our deepest aspirations is significant, contributing to our own well-being and rippling out to benefit others.</p><h3 id="""">Setting Sail</h3><p id="""">As we conclude this introduction to Guiding Aspirations, take a moment to appreciate the power of conscious intention.

Now, picture the Buddha stopping amidst this sea of foliage, bending down, and scooping up a handful of leaves. This simple act set the stage for one of his most practical teachings.<br></p><p id="""">The Buddha asked his students, <em id="""">""Which is greater, the leaves in my hand or those in the entire forest?""</em>&nbsp;<br></p><p id="""">His students, looking around at the vast expanse of the forest floor, replied that the leaves in the forest were far more numerous.<br></p><p id="""">The Buddha then shared an insight that would echo through the centuries: ""The teachings I have shared are like the leaves in my hand - just a small portion of what could be taught, but containing all that is necessary for awakening and liberation.""<br></p><p id="""">This powerful metaphor inspired the Handful of Leaves model, a framework designed to distill and present the essential elements of Buddhist teachings in an accessible, interconnected format for modern practitioners.<br></p><h3 id="""">A Universal Path: Ancient Wisdom for Everyone<br></h3><p id="""">The Handful of Leaves model aims to share the core of Buddhist wisdom in ways that are:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Universal</li><li id="""">Inclusive</li><li id="""">Free of dogma</li><li id="""">Relevant for everyone, regardless of background</li></ul><p id="""">While deeply rooted in Buddhist wisdom, this model is designed to be accessible and meaningful to people from all walks of life. It addresses fundamental aspects of human experience, providing teachings and practices that support well-being, clarity, and freedom.&nbsp;<br></p><p id="""">Whether you're a seasoned meditator or completely new to contemplative practices, this model offers a pathway to greater understanding and application of the Essential Dharma in meditation and mindful living practice<br></p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection:</em></strong><em id=""""> Before we dive deeper, take a moment to consider: What are you seeking in your own life?

Instead, they represent different facets of a single, cohesive experience. Though they may appear distinct, they are fundamentally interconnected and inseparable. This reflects their interconnectedness and their essential 'emptiness'—a key concept in Buddhist philosophy—which points to the lack of an inherent, separate existence from the greater whole of life.<br></p><p id="""">Think of it as an ecosystem where each element nourishes and is nourished by the others. Your aspiration fuels your practice, your practice cultivates wholesome states, these states allow for deeper contemplation, and so on in a beautiful, self-reinforcing cycle.<br></p><h3 id="""">The Purpose: From Daily Health to Profound Awakening<br></h3><p id="""">The Handful of Leaves model, like all Dharma practice, serves multiple purposes. It addresses both immediate, everyday concerns and profound, transformative aspirations. As reflected in a contemporary translation of the Satipatthana Sutta (The Four Foundations of Mindfulness), this path leads:<br></p><p id=""""><em id="""">""to the purification of hearts and minds, for the overcoming of unhealthy stress, depression and anxiety, for the transformation of suffering and discontentment, for attaining the noble path, for the realization of health, well-being, freedom, and awakening."" <sup id="""">1</sup></em><br></p><p id="""">This multifaceted approach acknowledges that we all come to these teachings with diverse needs and aspirations.

It's like tending a garden, encouraging beautiful flowers to bloom.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Transform Unwholesome Mind-States:</strong> This process directly confronts the roots of suffering, helping us work skillfully with challenging emotions and harmful habits.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Domains of Contemplation:</strong> These provide specific areas for our practice, offering guidance on what to observe in our experience. It's like having a map for the territory of our inner world.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">How to Contemplate:</strong> This category offers methods for our practice, teaching us how to observe our experience in ways that lead to clarity and insight.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Liberating Insights:</strong> These represent both the fruits of our practice and a force that continually reshapes our journey, leading to genuine healing, growth, well-being, happiness, and freedom.<br></li></ol><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Try This:</em></strong><em id=""""> Choose one category that particularly resonates with you right now.

Each component of the model relies on and reinforces the others, mirroring the interconnected nature of reality as taught in the Dharma.<br></p><p id="""">This interconnectedness isn't just a philosophical concept - it's something you can observe and experience in your own life. As you engage with these teachings, you may start to notice how a small change in one area can create ripple effects throughout your entire experience.<br></p><h3 id="""">An Invitation to Experiential Learning<br></h3><p id="""">It's important to approach this model experientially, not just intellectually. The Buddha encouraged his students to ""come and see for yourself"" (ehipassiko) rather than to simply believe. We invite you to use this model as a guide for investigation rather than a set of beliefs to adopt.<br></p><p id="""">As we explore each section, you'll find experiential exercises to help you engage directly with these teachings. These aren't just theoretical concepts - they're practical tools for transformation.<br></p><h3 id="""">The Importance of Community</h3><p id="""">The Buddha emphasized the importance of good spiritual friends (kalyāṇa-mitta) on the path. We encourage you to engage with these teachings in community (Sangha), supporting and being supported by others on the path. The support is infinitely beneficial and can’t be overstated. The journey towards greater well-being and awakening is one we can make together for the benefit of all beings.<strong id="""">‍</strong></p><h3 id="""">Your Journey Continues</h3><p id="""">As you engage in this exploration of the Handful of Leaves model, we invite you to approach it with an open mind and heart. Test these teachings in the laboratory of your own experience. See for yourself how they apply to your life and whether they lead to reduced stress, increased well-being, greater peace, wisdom, and compassion.</p><p id="""">In the coming sections, we'll dive deeper into each category, providing both theoretical understanding and practical exercises. Each step of the way, remember that this is your journey. Take what resonates, question what doesn't, and always prioritize your direct experience.</p><p id="""">May this Handful of Leaves guide you on your path, supporting you in cultivating wisdom and compassion, managing daily challenges, and ultimately realizing profound well-being and awakening.

But it's equally important to understand what Liberation is in positive terms:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Freedom from Suffering:</strong> In Nibbāna, all forms of suffering - from gross physical pain to subtle mental dissatisfaction - have ceased, like storm clouds dissipating in the clear sky.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Clear Seeing:</strong> It's a state of perceiving reality exactly as it is, without distortion or misunderstanding, like a sky free from haze or pollution.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Boundless Compassion:</strong> Liberation naturally gives rise to care and kindness for all beings, like the sky that provides space for all life to flourish.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Unshakeable Peace:</strong> Nibbāna is characterized by a profound, unchanging peace that's not dependent on external conditions, like the sky that remains vast and unperturbed regardless of the weather.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Transcendence of Limiting Views:</strong> In Liberation, all notions of self and other, being and non-being are transcended, just as the sky doesn't differentiate between the phenomena it contains.</li></ol><h3 id="""">The Dual Nature of Liberation</h3><p id="""">The aspiration for Liberation in the Handful of Leaves model operates on two interconnected levels:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Ultimate Liberation:</strong> This is the complete realization of Nibbāna, the final goal of the path. It's like recognizing oneself as the boundless sky in its totality.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Ongoing Liberation:</strong> This is the process of freeing ourselves from suffering and its causes in our everyday lives. It's like learning to identify less with the ""weather"" of our experiences and more with the spacious awareness that contains them.</li></ol><p id="""">These two aspects are not separate but intimately connected, like the clear sky and the phenomena within it. Our everyday experiences of freedom and clarity are not different from ultimate Liberation, just as a patch of clear blue sky is not separate from the sky itself. This understanding makes the aspiration for Liberation both inspirational and practical, giving us an ultimate goal to strive for while also providing guidance for our moment-to-moment experience.</p><h3 id="""">The Path is the Goal</h3><p id="""">In seeking Liberation, we come to a profound realization: the path itself is an expression of the goal. Just as every cloud, bird, or weather pattern is contained within the sky, every step on our journey is an expression of Liberation.</p><p id="""">This understanding transforms our practice. We no longer see Liberation as a distant state to be reached, but as the very awareness within which all experiences arise. Each moment of mindfulness, each act of kindness, each insight into the nature of reality is both a step towards Liberation and an experience of Liberation itself.</p><p id="""">By recognizing this, we bring the goal into the present moment. We practice not just to attain some future state, but to uncover the freedom and clarity that are always available here and now. This doesn't mean we abandon our aspiration for complete Liberation, but rather that we learn to touch it in every moment of our lives.</p><h3 id="""">How the Aspiration for Liberation Shapes Our Practice</h3><p id="""">Let's explore how this aspiration fulfills the five functions of Guiding Aspirations:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Setting the Tone for Our Practice:</strong> The aspiration for Liberation infuses our practice with a sense of possibility and purpose. It reminds us that freedom from suffering is not just a distant ideal, but a reality we can experience in increasing degrees as we progress on the path.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Maintaining a Long-Term Perspective:</strong> While Liberation represents the ultimate goal, it also provides a long-term vision that helps us navigate the ups and downs of daily practice. It connects our immediate efforts to a profound transformation of our entire being.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Inspiring Growth and Transformation:</strong> The aspiration for Liberation continually challenges us to look deeper, to question our assumptions, and to go beyond our habitual patterns. It inspires us to grow beyond what we thought possible.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Providing an Ethical Framework:</strong> Understanding Liberation as freedom from greed, hatred, and delusion naturally guides us towards ethical behavior. It encourages choices that lead to greater freedom for ourselves and others.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Cultivating Meaning and Purpose:</strong> This aspiration imbues our life and practice with profound meaning. It connects our personal journey to a timeless quest for ultimate freedom and understanding.</li></ol><h3 id="""">Cultivating the Aspiration for Liberation in Daily Life</h3><p id="""">While complete Liberation may seem distant, we can cultivate this aspiration in our everyday lives. Here are some ways:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Mindfulness of Spaciousness:</strong> Notice moments in your day when you feel a sense of mental spaciousness - perhaps when a worry subsides or when you let go of an expectation. These are glimpses of your sky-like nature.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Investigating Suffering:</strong> When you experience dissatisfaction or stress, investigate its causes without identifying with them. This inquiry is like observing weather patterns in the sky.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Letting Go Practice:</strong> Regularly practice letting go of thoughts, emotions, or desires that cause suffering. Each act of letting go is like allowing a cloud to pass through the sky without grasping at it.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Recognizing Interconnection:</strong> Cultivate awareness of how all things are interconnected and interdependent, like phenomena in the atmosphere. This insight dissolves the illusion of a separate self, bringing us closer to Liberation.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Touching Peace in the Present Moment:</strong> Through mindful breathing, walking, or other daily activities, experience moments of peace and freedom. These are expressions of Nibbāna available in everyday life.</li></ol><blockquote id=""""><strong><em id="""">Try This:</em></strong><em id=""""> For the next week, at the end of each day, reflect on moments when you experienced a sense of spaciousness or freedom. What conditions gave rise to these experiences? How might you cultivate more of these moments in your life?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">A Contemplative Exercise: Resting in the Sky of Awareness</h3><p id="""">To deepen your connection with the aspiration for Liberation, try this contemplative exercise:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Find a quiet place to sit comfortably. Allow your body to settle and your breath to find its natural rhythm.</li><li id="""">Imagine yourself as the vast, boundless sky. Feel your awareness expanding in all directions.</li><li id="""">As thoughts, emotions, and sensations arise, see them as clouds passing through your sky-like awareness.</li><li id="""">Notice how your awareness remains unchanged, regardless of what passes through it. Clear or stormy, your sky-nature remains the same.</li><li id="""">If you find yourself getting caught up in a particular thought or feeling, gently remind yourself: ""This too is just a passing cloud in the vast sky of my awareness.""</li><li id="""">As you end the meditation, carry this sense of vast, open awareness with you into your daily activities.</li></ol><blockquote id=""""><strong><em id="""">Reflection:</em></strong><em id=""""> After this exercise, how has your understanding of Liberation shifted? How might this perspective influence your approach to daily challenges and your overall practice?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">Living the Aspiration of Liberation</h3><p id="""">As we cultivate the aspiration for Liberation, we're not just working towards a distant goal. We're uncovering the boundless, sky-like nature of awareness that is always present, always free.</p><p id="""">Remember, the path to Liberation is gradual. It begins with small moments of freedom and clarity, deepens through consistent practice and insight, and culminates in complete Liberation. Every effort you make, no matter how small, is significant - each is an expression of the vast sky of awareness.</p><p id="""">As you move forward in your exploration of the Handful of Leaves model and your broader spiritual journey, let the aspiration for Liberation be your guiding star. May it inspire you to seek freedom in every moment, to question your limitations, and to realize your boundless nature. And may your journey towards Liberation bring benefit not only to yourself but to all beings everywhere, like the sky that provides space for all of life to unfold.</p>",false,"""The path to liberation helps us see the sky beyond the clouds—to know that peace and clarity are ever-present, no matter the circumstances.""",— Jesse Foy,jesse-foy,

This universal aspiration is not limited to our individual selves but naturally extends to those we love, and, when our hearts are open, to all beings everywhere. In the ""Handful of Leaves"" model, this guiding aspiration is recognized as ""Well-being for Self and Others"" (Sukhāya Hitāya Atthāya in Pali). It serves as a foundational principle, bridging the concerns of daily life with the highest spiritual goals.</p><p id="""">This aspiration acknowledges that true well-being is holistic, encompassing physical, mental, emotional, and social dimensions. It reminds us that our journey towards awakening is intimately connected with our overall health and happiness, and that of those around us. By caring for our well-being and the well-being of others, we lay a strong foundation for deeper spiritual practice and ultimate liberation.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection:</em></strong><em id=""""> Take a moment to connect with your own wish for well-being. What does it mean for you to be truly well? How does your well-being relate to the well-being of others in your life and the broader world?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">Understanding Well-being for Self and Others</h3><p id="""">In our interconnected world, well-being is increasingly recognized as a comprehensive state that includes not only physical health but also mental clarity, emotional resilience, social harmony, and environmental sustainability. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as ""a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."" This holistic perspective aligns closely with the Dharma, which teaches that true happiness and freedom from suffering are possible only when all aspects of our being are cared for.</p><h3 id="""">Some Key Dimensions of Well-being</h3><ol id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Physical Health:</strong> Our bodies are the vehicles through which we experience the world and engage in practice. Caring for our physical health through proper nutrition, exercise, rest, and preventative care is foundational to well-being.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Mental Health:</strong> A clear and balanced mind is essential for spiritual growth. Practices like mindfulness, meditation, and mental discipline help cultivate mental resilience and clarity, reducing anxiety, stress, and depression.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Emotional Well-being:</strong> Emotions are powerful forces that can either hinder or support our practice. Developing emotional intelligence, understanding our feelings, and cultivating positive states such as kindness, generosity, appreciative joy, compassion, and equanimity are vital to well-being.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Social Well-being:</strong> Our relationships and social connections play a crucial role in our overall health. Building supportive relationships, engaging in community, and contributing to the welfare of others enhance our sense of belonging and purpose.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Environmental Well-being:</strong> The health of our environment directly impacts our physical, mental, and social well-being. Living in harmony with nature, practicing sustainability, and caring for the planet are essential for the well-being of all beings.</li></ol><h3 id="""">The Systems Supporting Holistic Well-being</h3><p id="""">To achieve and maintain well-being for self and others, it is essential to recognize the broader systems that support health and happiness. These systems are not only personal but also social and environmental, including:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Healthcare Access:</strong> Universal access to healthcare services ensures that individuals can maintain their health, prevent illness, and receive timely treatment when needed. This access supports physical and mental health and is a fundamental aspect of well-being.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Education and Awareness:</strong> Health education promotes understanding and encourages practices that support well-being. Knowledge empowers individuals to make informed choices about their health, nutrition, and lifestyle.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Social Support Networks:</strong> Strong social connections and supportive relationships are crucial for mental and emotional well-being. Community resources, Sangha, family, and friends provide the support necessary for individuals to thrive.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Environmental Stewardship:</strong> A healthy environment is the foundation of well-being. Protecting natural resources, reducing pollution, and promoting sustainable practices ensure that the environment can continue to support human health and well-being.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Economic Stability and Access:</strong> Economic conditions directly affect access to healthcare, education, and nutrition. Stability in these areas supports well-being by providing the resources necessary for individuals to maintain their health and happiness.</li></ul><p id="""">These systems, when functioning effectively, create the conditions for individuals and communities to flourish. The aspiration for well-being extends beyond personal health, recognizing the importance of these broader systems in supporting the well-being of all beings.</p><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection:</em></strong><em id=""""> Consider how these systems are present in your life, your community, and the world.

This ongoing process of nurturing our physical, mental, and emotional health is integral to our spiritual journey.<strong id="""">‍</strong></li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Providing an Ethical Framework:</strong> <br>This aspiration guides our decision-making by encouraging us to consider the impact of our choices on our own well-being and that of others.

It connects our daily actions to a larger vision of collective health and happiness.</li></ol><h3 id="""">Nurturing Well-being in Daily Life</h3><p id="""">Cultivating well-being for ourselves and others is a practice that we can engage with throughout our day. Here are some practical ways to embody this aspiration:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Mindful Nutrition and Exercise:</strong> Care for your body by choosing nourishing foods and engaging in regular physical activity. Approach these activities with mindfulness, appreciating how they contribute to your overall well-being.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Mental and Emotional Care:</strong> Practice meditation and mindful living to cultivate mental clarity and emotional resilience. Regularly check in with your mental state, and take proactive steps to reduce stress and foster positive emotions.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Building Supportive Relationships:</strong> Cultivate relationships that are nurturing and uplifting.

Whether through volunteer work, social gatherings, or support groups, contribute to the health and happiness of your community.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Daily Reflection:</strong> At the end of each day, reflect on how your actions have contributed to your well-being and the well-being of others.

Each day, take one small action to nurture this aspect of well-being for yourself and one action to support it for someone else. Notice how this practice affects your overall sense of well-being and connection.</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">Well-being in the Context of Dharma Practice</h3><p id="""">The aspiration for Well-being for Self and Others is closely aligned with many aspects of the Buddhist path:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Ethical Living:</strong> The pursuit of well-being naturally aligns with ethical conduct, as actions that promote health and happiness are often those that avoid harm and foster care for others.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Mindfulness:</strong> The practice of mindfulness supports well-being by fostering a present-centered awareness that reduces stress and enhances mental and emotional health.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Compassion and Generosity:</strong> Acts of compassion and generosity are central to well-being, creating a sense of connection and purpose that enhances our happiness and that of others.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Contentment and Simplicity:</strong> True well-being includes a sense of contentment, which counters the craving and attachment that lead to suffering. Simplicity in lifestyle can contribute to greater peace and ease.</li></ul><h3 id="""">A Contemplative Exercise: The Circle of Well-being</h3><p id="""">To deepen your connection with this aspiration, try this contemplative exercise:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Find a comfortable seated position. Allow your body to settle and your breath to find its natural rhythm.</li><li id="""">Bring to mind something that contributes to your sense of well-being—perhaps a relationship, an activity, or a personal quality.</li><li id="""">Notice how this aspect of well-being feels in your body and mind. Allow yourself to fully appreciate and enjoy this feeling.</li><li id="""">Now, expand your awareness to include someone close to you. Wish for their well-being, imagining them experiencing the same sense of wellness you just felt.</li><li id="""">Gradually expand this circle to include more people—acquaintances, strangers, even those you find difficult.</li><li id="""">Finally, extend this wish for well-being to all beings everywhere.</li><li id="""">As you conclude, set an intention to carry this expansive sense of care for the well-being of all into your daily life.</li></ol><blockquote id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Reflection: </em></strong><em id="""">After this exercise, how do you feel? Has your perception of well-being shifted? How might this expanded view of well-being influence your daily choices and actions?</em></blockquote><h3 id="""">Well-being is part of the Path to Liberation for All</h3><p id="""">The aspiration for Well-being for Self and Others is not just about achieving temporary happiness or comfort. It is about creating conditions for profound transformation and ultimate liberation. Each act of care for our own well-being and that of others is a step on the path to awakening.</p><p id="""">Remember, this aspiration is not about achieving a perfect state of well-being, but about continually turning towards well-being, responding to suffering with compassion, and celebrating the joy and health we encounter.

They bring meaning in a collective way, a shared experience. One person defined ritual, which I really liked, as bringing a past and a future meaning to the present moment, to the present moment circumstances. We understand where we've been, and the conditions that led up to this moment, and how this moment is in direct relationship with the future.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Let this presence, this choosing presence, be a ritual of meaning that is available in every moment. We're not just opening our senses. We're becoming present to the very moments that are meaningful to our life. Others define ritual and the meaning within ritual to illuminate the sacred. As tradition says, what isn't sacred? Presence, mindful presence, is illuminating the sacred.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Three Refuges</strong></h4><p id="""">Speaking of rituals, we'll ring the bells three times, and these three bells are invitations to take refuge. Some say that this is a ritual, no matter where we're coming from, whatever tradition, faith, or place in life, that we don't have to abandon to take refuge in these rituals, in these refuges. We can take refuge in these things and still have these other things be profoundly meaningful to us. But these three refuges are the ritual that says if you practice these, then you are practicing the Dharma.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The First Refuge: Buddha Nature</strong></h4><p id="""">The first refuge is your own wakeful nature. Traditionally this is called Buddha nature, but it means awake to your great wisdom and great compassion... that is available to a mind that is liberated from identification, the ways of seeing and doing that prevent us from realizing this great luminous wakefulness, this great wisdom, this great compassion. This tradition says, ""You don't take refuge in an idea, you take refuge in what is here."" So this tradition says, ""Your wakeful nature is here,"" and we take refuge in what is here to whatever degree that it is here. Because if we're taking refuge in that, we're not taking refuge in our habit, our identification, the cloud. So with this bell, you're invited to take refuge in the wakefulness that is already here.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Second Refuge: Dharma</strong></h4><p id="""">We take refuge in the Dharma, and ultimately, the Dharma is the laws of life, nature, phenomena, suchness, from gravity to karma. But the Dharma is also the potential for learning and further awakening to our Buddha nature by understanding the laws of nature as they relate to our wakefulness, and as they relate to living in harmony with things in ways that bring benefit to self and others, and reduce harm in self and others. It's our learning and our practice. It's living intentionally, with care, to know ourselves, to cultivate ourselves, and to bring benefit to ourselves and others.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Third Refuge: Sangha</strong></h4><p id="""">And the third refuge is Sangha, community, companions, friends on the path, being nourished and nourishing others who share the desire to realize wakefulness for the benefit of self and others, to have a life that is inclined to presence in working with these things. What a beautiful refuge to have companions on the path. Mutually care for each other and the path.</p><p id="""">————————</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Introduction to Essential Dharma Study</strong></h3><p id="""">Thanks for coming to the Essential Dharma study group. We're beginning a journey that goodness knows how long it'll take in studying this particular framework. I've been doing a lot of thinking about how best to create a more contained, linear structure for us to learn and practice together this immense dharma.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Understanding Luminous Mind</strong></h4><p id="""">The dharma's so simple. It points to just transforming suffering and realizing wellbeing. But in order to do that, we want to be able to realize what's often referred to as luminous mind. Luminous mind is the mind that is awake, that is free. Ultimately, enlightened mind is luminous mind realized 24/7, but hold, hold that way, way into the future, 'cause it's also nice to have that luminous mind available to us more moments in the day.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Luminous mind is the natural state of mind that is awake, that is liberated, either temporarily or permanently with complete enlightenment supposedly. I don't know. Is one that is able to see in a way that is unattached by views, but informed by them and the rest of life.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Challenge: Identification with Smaller Self</strong></h4><p id="""">We have this mind that has a hard time realizing and abiding in its luminous nature. We get so wrapped up and identified with our conceptual thoughts, our views, our behaviors, our patterns, our implicit and explicit biases that we bring to our experience. The most severe manifestation of that which causes us and others suffering is the clinging to these things, the identification to these things.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">So our practice in the dharma is a practice to not cling and identify to the smaller sense of self that is not able to see beyond its own view, to see beyond its own habit, and to be able to position ourselves in a state of consciousness that is able to not only see what we are viewing, but also to see beyond, because we're not clinging to what we're viewing.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Many Paths, One Forest</strong></h4><p id="""">There's been hundreds of schools of dharma that approach things in different ways, based either on culture, a ritualized understanding of a particular approach. The dharma teachings are universal. It's like these dharma teachings are a forest, and different groups picked up different leaves and said, ""These are the leaves that reflect the whole of the forest, all of the leaves in the forest."" No matter how we approach the dharma, we're taking certain elements and we're using them to realize not just these elements, but this greater truth. We're studying these leaves to understand all the leaves in the forest, and that's just the way that it is.</p><p id="""">There are certain approaches that, you know, their leaf is you just sit and you watch the mind and do nothing, and that's a method. It's called the method of no method, but it's still a method, it's still a framework when you go into it.</p><p id="""">————————</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Four Foundations of Mindfulness Framework</strong></h3><p id="""">So what's central to a lot of this is that all of these dharma teachings share is this: there's luminous mind and then there's the mind that's everyday mind that we are very familiar with. And we want to figure out a path that takes us from this identified mind to luminous mind. There's a linear way that we can do this.</p><p id="""">One method that's directly and indirectly taught in pretty much all schools is teachings around the four foundations of mindfulness. So I've been trying to figure out what is the most healthy entry point for our linear path that really does contain an approach, not only for these four foundations that we'll get into, but that are the general approach to all things dharma. And how do we teach the four foundations and practice the four foundations in a way that teaches all of the dharma?</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Structure: Four Foundations, Fourteen Elements</strong></h4><p id="""">So we're gonna start at the four foundations of mindfulness. Start at the four foundations of mindfulness, mindfulness of body, feelings, mind, and dharmas. We're going to develop a framework, or learn a framework, that holds all of these four foundations that include 14 elements. 14 elements, and we're going to understand how all of these elements are approached. We're gonna understand what they mean in context of the path. We're gonna understand how we're supposed to take meaning from them, the states of mind that approaches them, and we'll kind of follow this in a linear way that will illuminate how we approach all dharma practice.</p><p id="""">So no matter what we study, we can study it, understand it, approach it, comprehend it, contemplate it from this general framework, which is the framework that we're asked to study all dharmas.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Breaking Down the Four Foundations</strong></h4><p id="""">The four foundations of mindfulness traditionally are divided into four categories:</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Body (B1-B6):</strong></h4><ul id=""""><li id="""">B1: Mindfulness of Breathing</li><li id="""">B2: Bodily Postures</li><li id="""">B3: Bodily Activities</li><li id="""">B4: Parts of the Body</li><li id="""">B5: Four Elements</li><li id="""">B6: Impermanence of the Body</li></ul><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Feelings (F):</strong></h4><p id="""">Something called feeling tones: pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, worldly, and unworldly.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Mind States (M):</strong></h4><p id="""">These are dispositions of mind, a mind that is contracted, a mind that is not contracted, that is liberated, a mind that is transcendent of our karmic conditionings, and a mind that is bound by them. So it's these general states of mind. It doesn't mean your thoughts, but it does often mean just what is on the mind, which can include thoughts.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Dharmas (D1-D5):</strong></h4><p id="""">The fourth category, which is called mindfulness of Dharma. These Dharmas, these five Dharmas, are:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">D1: Five hindrances</li><li id="""">D2: Five aggregates</li><li id="""">D3: Six sense spheres</li><li id="""">D4: Seven factors of enlightenment</li><li id="""">D5: Four noble truths</li></ul><p id="""">These are Dharmas that are extremely relevant to realizing mindfulness. So these are categories of Dharma teachings that are extremely relevant to our practice, worth knowing in every moment of our experience, that are worth cultivating.</p><p id="""">I like to remind myself and others that this includes all Dharma teachings. Everything we study in the Dharma, all of these lists, we can say, ""That can go here."" But these other ones are the dominant ones that have been kind of agreed upon with different translations of the Satipatthana Sutta that are most relevant. By the way, four noble truths includes the Eightfold Path, so that's in there, too.</p><p id="""">————————</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Practice Model</strong></h3><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Promise: Direct Path to Liberation</strong></h4><p id="""">This model, what Bhikkhu Anālayo calls the direct path, we're calling the promise. This practice promises liberation. This practice promises that if we look at these conditions, anxiety, unhealth, stress, all of these different things, non-realization, that if we practice this path, it is a direct path to be able to empower ourselves to transform the dukkha into happiness.</p><p id="""">""Thus, I have heard on one occasion, the Buddha addressed a gathering of monks. 'Friends,' he began. 'Venerable sir,' they replied. And the Buddha says, 'Friends, this is the direct path that leads to the purification of hearts and minds, the overcoming of unhealthy stress, depression, anxiety, or the transformation of suffering and discontent, for the attaining of the noble path, for the realization of health, well-being, freedom, and awakening. This is specifically the four foundations of mindfulness.'""</p><p id="""">So for all of us, if we're experiencing depression, anxiety, discontentment, from existential crisis, from anything. This is saying, ""Hey, this is the way to realize the Four Noble Truths. This is the way that we can put ourselves in the position that we can liberate ourselves from these things and realize these things.""</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Ground: Prerequisites for Practice</strong></h4><p id="""">The ground and the method are what Bhikkhu Anālayo calls the definition. The definition goes like this: What are these Four Foundations of Mindfulness? Hey, friends, regarding X, so this ground, X means one of these, or D, we'll just call it. Regarding D, body, feelings, we abide contemplating D, diligent, clearly knowing, and mindful, free from desire and discontent in regard to the world.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">This is huge. We're gonna spend a lot of time on figuring out what in the world does all of that mean, to not only the Four Foundations, but to the whole Dharma. This definition is the ground in which we approach our practice. It's kind of like the prerequisite. It is the steady ground that we stand on. If we don't have these elements taught throughout the Dharma, throughout all of the teachings, we don't necessarily have a solid Dharma practice or foundations practice.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Method: How We Practice</strong></h4><p id="""">The method, which Bhikkhu Anālayo calls the refrain, goes like this: In this way, regarding contemplating D, the Dharma, in the Dharma, we abide contemplating internally. We abide contemplating the Dharma externally. We abide contemplating both the Dharma internally and externally, which is a huge thing that we'll spend a lot of time on.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">We abide contemplating the nature of arising in the Dharma, body, feelings, mind. We abide contemplating the nature of passing away, of both arising and passing away. And then mindfulness, that there is this D, Dharma, is established just to the extent necessary for bare knowledge, this is huge, and continuity of mindfulness. And we abide independently without clinging to anything in the world.</p><p id="""">So that ground, that first part, and this method, the how, not only allows when it's applied to all of these Dharmas, these 14 elements, these Four Foundations, not only does it allow us to look at them in a particular way, it actually is the way that we practice that reveals luminous mind from the mind that is identified. They define how we approach the whole Dharma, the whole practice.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Results: Prediction of Awakening</strong></h4><p id="""">And so the results of this practice is what Bhikkhu Anālayo calls the prediction, and he predicts, or the Buddha does: ""Friends, if we develop these four Satipatthanas in such a way for seven years, one of two fruits can occur. Either we realize full awakening here and now, or that luminosity of mind, or if there's even a trace of clinging left, we enter non-returning having established the necessary conditionings for full awakening.""</p><p id="""">So, either this will illuminate if we're karmically predisposed, we can practice for a second and realize this awakening. Or more realistically, because we have learned how to approach our life from this framework, and if we're committed to it, it will lead to awakening. Because we saw it to a certain degree, there is no going back from unseeing it.</p><p id="""">This is one of the beautiful things about Dharma and mindfulness and these teachings. It changes the way that we view things. And once we see it, it's become so obvious that it's hard to unsee it and go back to being satisfied with the way that we were seeing things before. And so when they say you've become a stream enterer, stream enterer or never returner, well even more extreme, this is a person who they've unseen enough that eventually they will be led to realization.</p><p id="""">And then they give timeframes from seven days to seven years depending on our disposition, but he didn't say seven decades, so that's good. It's a little shorter.</p><p id="""">————————</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">The Importance of Intention</strong></h3><p id="""">Our whole practice is informed by the intentions that are related to this promise. So if we're practicing mindfulness with no intention, not realizing that this practice is to transform suffering and lead to the liberation and the happiness of awakening, we don't have a Four Foundations practice. We have to have meaning to the ritual, that we're practicing right now.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Has anyone just practiced meditation or tried to show it mindfully but forgot why you're doing it? You just go into the practice. We need to in order to have a certain amount of clear knowing and direction, we need to remember this promise and this direct path, what we're doing.</p><p id="""">In the teachings of the four foundations of mindfulness, they give us these extremely relevant areas to contemplate, because we get so identified to them, with them, that they prevent us from seeing fully, right? Or two, if we look at them in a particular way, they will reveal our luminous mind. They will reveal our liberation. So we're not doing anything with these foundations. We're using them as a way to change our seeing, the way that we perceive things from mindlessness to mindfulness.</p><p id="""">————————</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Why Study the Four Foundations?</strong></h3><p id="""">The engine of our practice is going to be these Dharmas and it's going to be the method, the objects of contemplation. So, why study the four foundations of mindfulness as the primary thing? Is because it is like the, like the Buddha said, it is the direct, a direct path to liberation. It is a direct path to realize the liberation from suffering and to realize the happiness that comes from liberation, the joy and the freedom and all of that.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">But not only that, it informs how we approach all of the Dharma. If we learn how to establish a way of seeing that is outlined in this vast teachings of the four foundations of mindfulness, we will be able to look at all Dharmas, meaning all the elements of our life, and the teachings in a way that help naturally prevent identification to wrong view, and unhelpful and the conditions that lead to that, and naturally allow us to realize the luminosity of our awakening.</p><p id="""">————————</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Closing Dedication</strong></h3><p id="""">I'll stop there. I know this is an overview for some of us, but I invite everyone as we explore this, to not see it as an overview, but see it with fresh eyes because we're gonna delve into each of these so deeply it's gonna be awesome. May we all realize our own luminosity.</p><p id="""">Every moment is a moment to develop peace for foundations of mindfulness. May our practice not only benefit us, may it help us benefit all those we come into contact with in this world that so desperately needs this kind and compassionate, wise relationship to it. As Stevie Wonder said, ""Love is in need of love today. Send yours in right away.""</p><p id="""">————————</p><p id=""""><em id="""">This teaching is part of an ongoing study group exploring the Four Foundations of Mindfulness as outlined in the Satipatthana Sutta. For deeper study, the teacher recommends Bhikkhu Anālayo's book ""Satipatthana"" and Joseph Goldstein's ""Mindfulness.""</em></p>",true,,,jesse-foy,

I call this approach ""Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness for the Sake of Clear Knowing,"" ;)</p><h4 id="""">Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness</h4><p id="""">The first interpretation of ""bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness"" emphasizes the importance of practicing mindfulness continuously and with a healthy sense of detachment from our experiences. This means applying just enough attention to know the objects of our attention, while not becoming identified and attached to our perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and other mental states.</p><p id="""">This approach emphasizes the importance of maintaining a continuous awareness of our our inner and outer experiences, without slipping into mindlessness or distraction. By doing so, we can avoid unbeneficial or unhealthy thoughts, speech, and actions, and respond to situations with greater awareness and skillfulness.</p><h4 id="""">Mindfulness for the Sake of Clear Knowing</h4><p id="""">The second interpretation of ""mindfulness for the sake of clear knowing"" emphasizes the importance of using mindfulness to develop clear and direct understanding of what we are experiencing in the present moment. This approach suggests that mindfulness gives rise to a deeper and more clear kind of knowing related to insight and wakefulness.</p><p id="""">While ""bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness"" emphasizes the importance of developing an ongoing and unbroken awareness, ""mindfulness for the sake of clear knowing"" emphasizes the importance of using mindfulness to gain insight into the nature of our experiences and the causes of suffering how we can be free of them.</p><h4 id="""">Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness for the Sake of Clear Knowing</h4><p id="""">While these two interpretations may seem different, they are actually complimentary and mutually reinforcing. By practicing mindfulness continuously and with a sense of detachment, we can maintain an ongoing and unbroken awareness of our life as it is in each precious moment. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the nature of reality and the causes of suffering, which can ultimately lead to greater wisdom, compassion, and inner peace.</p><p id="""">Similarly, by using mindfulness to develop clear and direct understanding of our experiences, we can cultivate greater awareness, understanding, and equanimity in our daily lives. This can help us respond to situations with greater wisdom and compassion, rather than reacting impulsively or habitually.</p><h4 id="""">Mental Labeling</h4><p id="""">One powerful tool for practicing ""Bare Knowledge and Continuous Mindfulness for the Sake of Clear Knowing"" is the technique of mental labeling. By labeling our experiences as they arise, we can develop greater awareness and understanding of our thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations without being attached to them.</p><p id="""">Mental labeling can help us develop clear and direct understanding of our hearts and minds. And, it can also help us maintain an ongoing and unbroken awareness of our life. By labeling our experiences as they arise, we can avoid getting caught up in our habitual patterns of thought and behavior, and respond to situations with greater awareness and skillfulness.</p><p id="""">However, it is important to note that mental labeling should be used only as long as it is useful, and then let go of once ""ñāṇamattāya paṭis­sati­mattāya"" has become relatively stable.</p><p id="""">May we all continue to cultivate Mindfulness practice that leads to the purification of our hearts and minds, for the overcoming of unhealthy stress, depression and anxiety, for the transformation of suffering and discontentment, for attaining the noble path, for the realization of health, well-being, freedom, awakening, and the benefit of all beings.</p>",false,"""The present moment is filled with joy and happiness.

These teachings are essential to our practice, as they can help us cultivate our mind, know our mind, and awaken our mind, ultimately leading to freedom..</p><h4 id="""">The Nature of Arising and Passing Away</h4><p id="""">The teachings on arising and passing away are concerned with the impermanent nature of all phenomena, whether they be physical, mental, or emotional. These teachings invite us to recognize that all aspects of experience are subject to change, and are in a constant state of arising and passing away. By recognizing this process character of all aspects of experience, we can develop insight into the impermanent nature of things, and thus come to know and understand them more deeply.</p><p id="""">In practical terms, this means paying attention to our experiences in the present moment. When we experience anger, for example, we can notice when it arises, and when it passes away. Through this process of recognition, we can appreciate that the nature of arising of mental states has its complement in the nature of their passing away. The same holds for the body, feelings, or dharmas.</p><p id="""">Recognizing the presence and absence of mental states like anger can help us realize the all-pervasive aspect of experience. This awareness of change comes with a built-in pointer towards emptiness. Seeing the arising and passing away of phenomena can help us let go, no longer holding on to one thing or another as something that ""is"" or ""is not."" All is simply an arising and a passing away.</p><h4 id="""">Cultivating Insight into Impermanence</h4><p id="""">To cultivate insight into impermanence, we can turn to the practice of mindfulness. The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta outlines four contemplations of body, feelings, mind, and dharmas as ways of establishing mindfulness. </p><p id="""">The ""cultivation"" of these four modes of establishing mindfulness takes place through contemplating the nature of arising, passing away, and both in relation to each of these four. In other words, the foundation laid by way of establishing mindfulness of the body, feelings, mind, and dharmas should lead on to cultivating insight into impermanence in order to actualize the liberating potential of mindfulness practice. </p><p id="""">From a practical viewpoint, the instructions to contemplate the nature of arising, passing away, and both can be fulfilled even if we miss the actual moment of arising or the actual moment of passing away. The swiftness of such moments makes it challenging to be aware of them at the exact time they occur. Instead, from a practical viewpoint, these instructions can be understood to cover the retrospective realization that a particular phenomenon has arisen and is now present or that, in the meantime, it has passed away and is no longer present. This realization is enough to understand that this phenomenon is indeed of the nature to arise and pass away.</p><h4 id="""">The Liberating Effect of Impermanence</h4><p id="""">When we see deeply that all that is subject to arising is also subject to cessation, that whatever arises will also pass away, the mind becomes disenchanted. This disenchantment leads to dispassion, and through dispassion, the mind is liberated.</p><p id="""">The teachings on impermanence remind us that all phenomena are impermanent, unreliable, and unsatisfying. This means that anything we grasp at is fleeting and will inevitably pass away. It is impossible to point to anything as a self-sufficient and independent entity that exists on its own. All is simply an arising and a passing away.</p><p id="""">By cultivating insight into impermanence, we can become disenchanted with our attachments and become dispassionate. This dispassionate mind is one of open-heartedness and equanimity. It is the mind that can hold all things, but not be held by anything. We can see that all things are in a constant state of change, including ourselves. When we hold onto things too tightly, we are bound to suffer because we are trying to hold onto something that is already slipping away from us. But by embracing impermanence, we can find freedom from this suffering.</p><h4 id="""">Liberation from Suffering</h4><p id="""">The Buddha taught that the root of all suffering is attachment. We cling to things because we believe they will bring us happiness, but they are always subject to change, and when they inevitably do change, we suffer. The practice of cultivating insight into impermanence can help us break free from this cycle of suffering. By recognizing that all things are impermanent, we can learn to let go of our attachments and find true liberation from suffering.</p><p id="""">We can also see that everything is interconnected and interdependent. Nothing exists independently of everything else. We are all connected in the web of life, and by embracing impermanence, we can learn to see the interdependence of all things. When we understand that everything is in a constant state of change, we can learn to live in harmony with the natural flow of life. We can learn to appreciate the beauty of the present moment.</p><h4 id="""">Home Contemplations and Practice</h4><p id="""">To realize the liberating power of impermanence, we need to cultivate insight into it, and the best way to do this is through mindfulness meditation practice. Here are three suggestions for practicing with impermanence in meditation and mindful living practice.</p><h5 id="""">Meditation Contemplations:</h5><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Contemplate the breath:</em></strong> The breath is a useful object for observing impermanence. Each breath arises and passes away, just like all phenomena. By focusing on the breath and observing it closely, we can cultivate insight into the nature of arising, passing away, and both.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Contemplate physical sensations:</em></strong> Our bodies are constantly changing, and physical sensations are a great way to observe impermanence. By tuning in to the sensations in our bodies and observing them closely, we can see how they arise, pass away, and change.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Contemplate mental states:</em></strong> Our thoughts and emotions are also constantly changing, and by observing them closely in meditation practice, we can see the impermanence in action. Notice how thoughts and emotions arise, pass away, and change over time.</p><h5 id="""">Mindful Living Contemplations:</h5><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Contemplate how things arise and pass away at our five senses:</em></strong> When we focus on our senses, we can see the constant arising and passing away of things. For example, when we look at the weather, we can see how it changes throughout the day and throughout the seasons. It's never the same for even a moment. By observing this change, we can develop an understanding of impermanence.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Contemplate moods, emotions, and feelings within yourself and others:</em></strong> Our moods, emotions, and feelings are also subject to the law of impermanence. One day we may feel happy, the next day we may feel sad. By observing this change within ourselves and others, we can develop a greater sense of understanding and compassion. When we see that our suffering and the suffering of others arises and passes away, we can begin to cultivate a sense of non-attachment to these emotions.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Contemplate thoughts, views, and opinions within yourself and others:</em></strong> Just like our senses and emotions, our thoughts, views, and opinions are also subject to the law of impermanence. Our beliefs and opinions may change over time as we gain new experiences and insights. By observing this change within ourselves and others, we can develop a greater sense of openness and non-judgment. We can learn to see others' views and opinions as simply arising and passing away, rather than seeing them as a fixed part of who they are.</p>",false,"""Better it is to live one day seeing the rise and fall of things than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the rise and fall of things.”",Buddha,jesse-foy,

Today, we’ll explore this contemplation from Three perspectives. Each perspective offers unique insights related to the establishment of mindfulness and our dharma practice as a whole.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Contemplating Self and Other</strong></p><p id="""">The first way of contemplation invites us to view our personal experience, both physically and mentally, from the perspective of self and others. We are invited to observe our individual experience of the body, feelings, mind-heart, and actions as well as contemplate the experience of others. By understanding ourselves, we can begin to understand others, and by understanding others, we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves. </p><p id="""">Contemplating both self and other, we can see how each affects the other and how our thoughts and actions impact others and how others impact us. This perspective can also be helpful in cultivating positive relationships and resolving conflicts with others. </p><p id="""">Furthermore, this practice can help us to recognize our interconnectedness, cultivate compassion and empathy, and develop a shared humanity between self and other.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Contemplating the Internal and External</strong></p><p id="""">A second way of contemplation involves the observation of the inner world of thoughts, feelings, and mental events, as well as the external world of our present moment environment. It highlights the interconnectedness between internal and external events, where external and internal events are mutually interdependent and co-create one another. </p><p id="""">By cultivating mindfulness of the inner and outer world, we can gain a deeper understanding of how our internal experiences influence our perceptions of the external world and vice versa. This understanding can help us to develop greater awareness of the patterns and habits that govern our lives and to make positive changes. </p><p id="""">Additionally, by contemplating both the internal and external, we can begin to recognize the impermanence and transience of all things, leading to greater acceptance of change and an appreciation of the present moment.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Contemplating Interdependence</strong></p><p id="""">The third way of contemplation involves contemplating the interdependence of all things. It recognizes that we, as individuals, are not separate from the greater whole, the web of life. Likewise, the whole is not separate from the individual. </p><p id="""">Through this contemplation, we can see that all things arise within an interconnected web of systems, full of ever-changing causes and conditions that are born into each moment. The concepts of emptiness, dependent origination, and karma can be understood through the practice of contemplating internally, externally, and both internally and externally. </p><p id="""">By understanding the interconnectedness of all things, we can begin to cultivate a deeper appreciation for our interconnectedness and a sense of responsibility for our actions and a greater commitment to the well-being of all beings.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">A Wholistic Approach</strong></p><p id="""">Each of these ways of contemplation is unique, yet they are all interconnected and interdependent. They offer different perspectives on how to cultivate mindfulness and insight, and together they provide a more wholistic approach to Buddhist practice. </p><p id="""">A wholistic approach to the practice of Satipatthana invites us to contemplate internally, externally, and both internally and externally, and to see the interconnectedness of all things. Through these different perspectives, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of ourselves, others, and the world around us. </p><p id="""">This understanding can lead to greater compassion, wisdom, and transformation in our lives. May we continue to cultivate mindfulness and insight, embracing the interconnectedness of all things.</p><h4 id="""">Contemplations and Practice</h4><p id="""">Be mindful of what is going on within yourself, others, the world, and the relational web of interdependence that all of these thing arise within.</p>",false,"""Through the cultivation of mindfulness, we come to see that the internal, the external, and both the internal and external are interconnected and interdependent, and that by embracing this interconnectedness, we can cultivate greater compassion, wisdom, and transformation in our lives.""",Jesse Foy,jesse-foy,
Satipatthana Sutta Study: Independent and Without Clinging,satipatthana-sutta-study-independent-and-without-clinging,5fb2f823dd801635b9416eaf,653aca94fee370592ef53f08,6412510ee41c11486d115df0,false,false,Wed Mar 15 2023 23:13:18 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Mar 16 2023 01:26:10 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Mar 16 2023 01:26:26 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Satipatthana Sutta Study: Independent and Without Clinging,false,,,"<p id="""">In this lesson, we will explore the concept of being ""independent and without clinging,"" as described in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta. </p><h4 id="""">The Meaning of ""Independent and Without Clinging""</h4><p id="""">To be ""independent and without clinging"" reflects a mental state free from attachments or clinging, including not clinging to sensory experiences, thoughts, emotions, and mental objects. By developing an attitude of non-attachment, we observe the impermanent nature of all things and see that clinging to the ever-changing aspect of our experience leads to suffering. Through this understanding, we cultivate greater equanimity, understanding, and compassion within our practice and life.</p><h4 id="""">Cultivating a Healthier Sense of Self and Lessening Unhealthy Ego Attachment</h4><p id="""">Through the practice of non-attachment, we grow our capacity to be more aware of how our ego sometimes seeks validation, security, and comfort in unbeneficial ways. By letting go of unhealthy desires, aversions, and views, we begin to loosen the grip of the unhealthy ego attachment that keeps us stuck in cycles of craving, aversion, and non-wakefulness.</p><p id="""">Through our practice, we develop a healthier sense of self, not defined by external circumstances or our reactions to them. We benefit ourselves and others by becoming more empowered to respond to life in ways that reduce harm. We then experience a deeper connection with ourselves and the world around us, free from the constraints imposed by our ego.</p><h4 id="""">Independent and Without Clinging: Lessening Identification with Thoughts, Emotions, and Views</h4><p id="""">One of the most powerful functions of mindfulness practice is that it increases our ability to observe our thoughts, emotions, and views without identifying with them. We see the impermanent and interdependent nature of all things; we see how this view is realized through the practice of being independent and without clinging.</p><p id="""">Over time, we become increasingly able to see our thoughts and emotions as impermanent, constantly changing phenomena that do not define our true nature. This recognition helps us disentangle ourselves from the stories we tell ourselves and the views we hold, enabling us to live with greater wakefulness, freedom, understanding, and compassion.</p><h4 id="""">Seclusion and Taking Refuge</h4><p id="""">When we practice in a way that is ""independent and without clinging,"" we become more ""secluded"" from our ""doings"" and our habitual way of reacting to life experience. We turn toward and take refuge in our Buddha nature and Dharma practice. Seclusion, in this sense, does not necessarily mean physical isolation but refers to a mental state of being undisturbed by our inner and outer world distractions and disturbances.</p><p id="""">By taking refuge in the part of us that is wiser and more compassionate, we cultivate a greater sense of stability and peace, independent of external inner and outer conditions that can hinder us. We better navigate the complexities of life and respond with understanding and care. </p><h4 id="""">Cultivating Greater Self-Awareness, Self-Development, Health, Well-being, Wakefulness, and Liberation</h4><p id="""">By practicing ""independent and without clinging,"" we better understand ourselves, others, and our world. As we let go of unhealthy attachments, we cultivate greater mindfulness; we understand our thoughts, emotions, and actions. Our increased understanding leads to self-development as we learn to respond to life with wisdom and compassion rather than from our habitual patterns of seeing and being. We realize greater health and well-being by reducing stress, anxiety, and other negative emotions often arising from attachment and clinging.</p>",false,"""Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to anything - anger, anxiety, or possessions - we cannot be free.""",— Thich Nhat Hanh,jesse-foy,

In order to practice wise and compassionate self-reflection, it's important to cultivate what's called ""Right View"" according to the 8-Fold Path, the heart of the Buddha's teachings.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Importance of Right View</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>Right view allows us to move in the right direction on our spiritual path towards wakefulness and liberation. And, it enables us to practice self-reflection as a tool for realization.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Cultivating Self-Reflection</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>The kind of self-reflection that we are trying to cultivate is a way of looking at ourselves in a manner that is not bound or entangled within our self-cherishing and clinging to all that we think we are and know. We are training to see ourselves in a way that is beyond the limitations of our fixed views, and the habitual beliefs and actions that arise from them.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Dharma Mirror: A True Reflection</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>We want to be able to look into the Dharma Mirror to see a true reflection. But this mirror is typically covered by the dust of our habitual ignorance. It is covered by the thoughts, emotions, fears, grasping, aversions, etc., that we mistake as reflections of ourselves and the world. But they are like dust that clouds the mirror, obscuring the truth of what is actually present in the moment.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Training to See Clearly</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>So we need to train ourselves to remove the dust. It's as if the mirror itself is kind of sticky. But that stickiness is our self-clinging. Clinging to our habitual views and intentions. If we let go of this clinging, and even let go of the belief in some kind of self that we identify with, we will actually remove the stickiness. And we will see the self that is presently standing in front of the mirror more clearly.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Beyond the Self</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>It's not that we will not see thoughts, emotions, or the sensory world of which we are a part. But we will see them without identifying with them. Without needing to grasp onto them. Or push them away. We will see that they are all arising within an infinite ever-changing web of interdependence and causes and effects. There is no fixed self to get caught or identified with. We break free from a smaller sense of self and realize a greater self-nature.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Awakening to Wakefulness</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>This greater nature is our wakefulness. It is a nature that is free from the limitations of the smaller sense of self through which we typically see our lives. We become able to see through our wakeful eyes, with its capacity for great wisdom and great compassion. It's not that our smaller self does not exist. It does. But we see that it too arises according to the causes and conditions of this interconnected life. We see that much of this smaller sense of self is born out of our positive and negative Karmic conditioning. Self-reflection sees all of this, but through the eyes of our Buddha Nature.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Deep Reflection in Meditation</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>So, this meditation is like a mirror. Where we look deeply into it with the intention to see our true reflection, which is the ripe fruit of our Karmic conditioning interwoven into the universal web of interrelated causes and conditions.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Balanced Observation and Insight</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>We are training ourselves to see it all in a balanced, concentrated, and mindful way. We are training to see in ways that are not caught up within our smaller conditioned sense of self. But we are seeing it arise. When we see the nature of our conditioning at play, we can gain insight into it. We can better understand what is healthy and beneficial for ourselves and others, and we can see what is unhealthy and unbeneficial.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Concept of Emptiness</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>Another way of thinking about this meditation practice as a mirror is a bit more abstract. All things are arising and passing away within our concentrated mindful awareness. In this tradition, we know this to be ""Emptiness"". All things are empty of a fixed sense of self that we can call the eternal or true self. Everything arises through causes and conditions. If one thing changes, so does the so-called ""self"". Therefore, it is said to be empty of a fixed unchanging nature. This applies to ourselves and everything else in existence.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Embracing Empty Reflection</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>So we can say that the true reflection is empty. And the self, you and me, who look into the mirror is also empty. Everything that arises is empty. Yet it is full of all that is created in accordance with Karma and inter-dependent co-arising. So, it is emptiness looking at the fullness of emptiness arising and passing away. Empty of what? Fixed self. Full of what? All interrelated causes and conditions.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The Challenge of Conceptualization</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>With all of this said, in this meditation, we are training to see in this way. We can't think too long about it because our thoughts will never accurately capture the experience of this way of seeing. In fact, the more we imagine what we will see, the more obscured the mirror will become by the dust of our preconceptions.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Simplicity and Profound Realization</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>This meditation may at first appear to be too simple to be able to awaken us so profoundly. Thankfully, It is simple, but simple does not mean easy, nor does it mean that it is not effective in showing us how to see differently. This it's magic is in the actual practice. It's not something to understand so much as it is something to do. And if we do it with sincerity, we will see it. When we see it over and over, we uncover our Buddha nature. And we slowly come to understand how we have become enchanted by our smaller sense of self. And because we see this enchantment, we see how it is both driven by and creates the cycle of dukkha, or samsara.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Practice Reminders</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>In this meditation, please practice it with sincere diligence. With wise and compassionate effort. Remember, putting the breath at the forefront of your experience connects you to the present moment. But you're open to everything. You're looking into the Dharma mirror. You're not identified with the smaller sense of self. But that's what you're seeing. You're even curious about it. But you're letting it all rise and fall. You're learning how to differentiate your Buddha eyes from your ego eyes. You're learning to see what is ""not-self"". Which paradoxically opens you up to your true nature. It is your true nature, your Buddha nature, through which you want to see the world. Not only through your an attachment to a smaller egoic self. And, in this way, you are getting to know the nature of both.<br></p>",true,,,jesse-foy,

Each layer corresponds to one of the three divisions.</p><h4>THE LAYER OF LATENT TENDENCY - WISDOM DIVISION</h4><p>In this layer, the seeds of the unwholesome states called latent tendencies lie dormant within the mind, ready to manifest when the right causes and conditions arise. For example, if we are in a peaceful environment, with no disturbance to our sense of self, our latent tendencies remain dormant. However, if our peace is disrupted, our sense of self may be threatened, and unwholesome mind-states may manifest.</p><p><strong><em>The Wisdom Division of the Eightfold Path </em></strong>illuminates and transforms latent tendencies at the roots. These unwholesome mind-states are ultimately rooted in delusion/ignorance. Ignorance is the field that pervasively distorts our views, thinking, actions, and all other activities. When we cultivate Wise View and Wise Thinking, all other path factors become unified and eventually purify the mind of latent unwholesome tendencies.</p><h4>THE LAYER OF MANIFESTATION - MENTAL CULTIVATION</h4><p>In this layer, the latent tendencies become activated through a stimulus, manifesting as unwholesome thoughts, feelings, intentions, or other mental volitions.</p><p><strong><em>The Mental Cultivation Division of the Eightfold Path </em></strong>removes unwholesome manifestations that have arisen in the mind and protects the integrity of current mind-states. When right energy, mindfulness, and concentration are active, the mind catches the proliferation of mental unwholesomeness and prevents them from manifesting into the layer of transgression.</p><h4>THE LAYER OF TRANSGRESSION - SILA TRAINING</h4><p>In this layer, the unwholesome manifestations lead to harmful actions of body or speech.</p><p><strong><em>The Moral (Sila) Training Division of the Eightfold Path </em></strong>protects against the proliferation of unwholesome manifestations of speech and activities that have already arisen.</p>",false,"“Leting go of the harmful, cultivating the beneficial, and purifying the heart-mind: This is the teaching....”",- Buddha,jesse-foy,
